# Query the Activity Feed

Copy page



The Activity Feed records authentication, chat, file, project, administrative, and platform activity across your organization and returns it in reverse chronological order. Activities are queryable within 1 minute of occurring and are retained for 6 years. Recording is not retroactive: it begins when the Compliance API is first enabled for your organization, and activity from before enablement is not backfilled.

## Filter activities

Filter by organization, actor, activity type, or a `created_at` time window using the dotted sub-parameters `created_at.gte`, `.gt`, `.lte`, and `.lt`. See the [API reference](api/compliance/activities/list.md) for each parameter's type and accepted values.

Repeatable parameters use array-bracket query syntax: pass `activity_types[]=...`, `actor_ids[]=...`, or `organization_ids[]=...` once for each value.

The Activity Feed produces hundreds of distinct activity types. See [Query compliance activities](api/compliance/activities/list.md) in the API reference for the full list of values that `activity_types[]` accepts.

## Paginate results

Activities are returned newest first, with ties in `created_at` broken by activity ID, and capped at `limit` results in each response (default 100, max 5,000). See the [API reference](api/compliance/activities/list.md) for the full response schema.

The Compliance API uses two pagination schemes depending on the endpoint family:

| Endpoint family | Sort order | Scheme | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activities | Newest first | Cursor | `after_id`, `before_id` (returned as `first_id`, `last_id`) |
| Chats and chat messages | Oldest first | Cursor | `after_id`, `before_id` (returned as `first_id`, `last_id`) |
| Organizations, projects, project attachments, users, roles, role permissions, groups, group members | Endpoint-specific | Page token | `page` (returned as `next_page`) |
| Local and remote sessions and session messages | Sessions newest first; messages oldest first by default | Page token | `page` (returned as `next_page`) |

Files do not paginate: they are retrieved individually by ID.

Pagination cursors and page tokens are opaque strings: pass them back unchanged. Their internal format is not stable, and parsing them will break without notice. Only one of `after_id` or `before_id` may be set in each request, and both schemes return `has_more` so you know when to stop. The session endpoints (local and remote) are the exception: they return `next_page` without `has_more`, so stop when `next_page` is `null`.

To page through activities:

- Pass the response's `last_id` as `after_id` to advance to the next page in result order. With activities sorted newest first, the next page contains older entries.
- Pass `first_id` as `before_id` to return to the previous page.
- Stop when `has_more` is `false`.

The cursor parameter sets the page direction; the endpoint's sort order sets the time direction. The same `after_id` parameter reaches older activities here. Chats sort oldest first; see [Retrieve and delete chats, files, and projects](manage-claude/compliance-content-data.md) for the cursor semantics there.

```shiki
# Fetch the first page (newest activities first) and capture its trailing cursor.
last_id=$(curl --fail-with-body -sS \
  "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/compliance/activities?limit=2" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_ACCESS_KEY" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" | jq -er '.last_id')

# Pass the cursor back unchanged to fetch the next (older) page.
curl --fail-with-body -sS -G \
  "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/compliance/activities" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_ACCESS_KEY" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --data-urlencode "limit=2" \
  --data-urlencode "after_id=${last_id}"
```

A production **backfill** loop pages through older activities by driving iteration off `has_more` and `last_id`:

1. Start from your stored cursor (or omit `after_id` to start from the beginning).
2. Page through with `after_id=<last_id>` until `has_more` is `false`.
3. Persist the final `last_id` only after you've stored every page it covers.

```inline-block
cursor = stored_cursor
loop:
  if cursor is not null:
    page = GET /v1/compliance/activities?after_id={cursor}&limit=100
  else:
    page = GET /v1/compliance/activities?limit=100
  store(page.data)
  if page.last_id is not null:
    cursor = page.last_id
  if not page.has_more: break
persist(cursor)
```

## Understand the Activity object

Every entry in `data` is an Activity with this top-level shape:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the activity. |
| `created_at` | RFC 3339 string | When the activity occurred. |
| `organization_id` | string or null | Organization where the activity occurred, or `null` for events not tied to an organization (sign-in, sign-out, Compliance API calls). |
| `organization_uuid` | string or null | Same scoping as `organization_id`, expressed as a UUID. |
| `actor` | Actor union | Who or what performed the activity. See the following actor table. |
| `type` | string | The activity type, for example `claude_chat_created`. |
| *additional fields* | varies | Type-specific fields, for example `claude_chat_id` on chat events or `filename` on file events. See [Query compliance activities](api/compliance/activities/list.md) in the API reference for the per-type field list. |

The `actor` field is a discriminated union. The `type` discriminator tells you which other fields are present:

| `actor.type` | When it appears | Key fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user_actor` | A signed-in claude.ai or Claude Console user took the action. | `email_address`, `user_id`, `ip_address`, `user_agent` |
| `api_actor` | A request called the Claude API or the Compliance API with a customer-issued API key. Compliance API calls produce this actor type for both Compliance Access Keys and Admin API keys. | `api_key_id`, `ip_address`, `user_agent` |
| `admin_api_key_actor` | An organization admin used an Admin API key to manage users, invites, workspaces, or API keys. | `admin_api_key_id`, `ip_address`, `user_agent` |
| `unauthenticated_user_actor` | An action occurred before sign-in completed, for example `sso_login_initiated`. | `unauthenticated_email_address`, `ip_address`, `user_agent` |
| `anthropic_actor` | Anthropic acted on the organization, for example through internal tooling. | `email_address` (always `null`; present for shape consistency with `user_actor`, because Anthropic operators are not represented by individual email) |
| `scim_directory_sync_actor` | An identity provider (such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or JumpCloud) pushed a change through SCIM directory sync. | `workos_event_id`, `directory_id`, `idp_connection_type` (nullable; for example `OktaSCIMV2`, `AzureSCIMV2`) |

A `claude_*_viewed` activity means a Claude app loaded content, not that a person viewed it. Types such as `claude_chat_viewed`, `claude_file_viewed`, and `claude_project_viewed` are recorded each time a Claude app loads the chat, file, or project from Anthropic's servers. Repeated loads are not deduplicated. The web, desktop, and mobile apps load content at different moments, sometimes in the background, and can display a cached copy without loading it. Counts of these activities vary by platform as a result, and they do not correspond to messages sent or screens viewed.
