# Create an Admin API key

Copy page



An Admin API key authenticates every API in the **Admin** section of this guide: the [Admin API](manage-claude/admin-api.md), [Analytics APIs](manage-claude/analytics-api.md), [Compliance API](manage-claude/compliance-api.md), [Spend Limits API](manage-claude/spend-limits-api.md), [Usage and Cost API](manage-claude/usage-cost-api.md), and [Rate Limits API](manage-claude/rate-limits-api.md). You do not need a separate key for each API. The one exception is the Admin API's service-account, federation-issuer, and federation-rule endpoints, which accept only an OAuth bearer token with the `org:admin` scope. See [Obtain an OAuth bearer token](manage-claude/admin-api.md).

Where you create the key depends on which Claude product your organization uses.

##  Which key do you need?

| Your organization | Create the key in | Key prefix | Who can create it | Works with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Console** (Claude Platform, `platform.claude.com`) | [Claude Console > Settings > Admin keys](https://platform.claude.com/settings/admin-keys) | `sk-ant-admin01-...` | Organization members with the **admin** role | [Admin API](manage-claude/admin-api.md), [Usage and Cost API](manage-claude/usage-cost-api.md), [Rate Limits API](manage-claude/rate-limits-api.md), [Claude Code Analytics API](manage-claude/claude-code-analytics-api.md), and the Compliance API [Activity Feed](manage-claude/compliance-activity-feed.md) |
| **Claude Enterprise** (`claude.ai`) | [claude.ai > Organization settings > API](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/api-access) | `sk-ant-api01-...` | The parent organization's **primary owner** (all linked organizations). An **organization owner** can create one carrying Compliance API scopes only, restricted to their own organization | [User management](manage-claude/user-management.md) (the Admin API's member, invite, and group endpoints, in beta), [Compliance API](manage-claude/compliance-api.md), [Claude Enterprise Analytics API](manage-claude/analytics-api.md), and [Spend Limits API](manage-claude/spend-limits-api.md), according to the [scopes](#choose-scopes-for-a-claude-enterprise-key) you select |

A key created in one organization cannot be used to manage a different organization. If your company uses both Claude Console and Claude Enterprise, create one key in each.

##  Create a key for a Claude Console organization

1. 1

   Sign in as an organization admin

   Only organization members with the **admin** role can create Admin API keys. See [Organization roles and permissions](manage-claude/admin-api.md).
2. 2

   Open Admin keys settings

   Go to [Claude Console > Settings > Admin keys](https://platform.claude.com/settings/admin-keys).
3. 3

   Create the key

   Click **Create key**, give it a name, choose an [expiration](manage-claude/authentication.md), and click **Create**. Claude Console keys do not have selectable scopes; every key carries full access to all endpoints that accept Admin API keys (the service-account and federation endpoints noted at the top of this page do not accept Admin API keys).
4. 4

   Copy and store the secret

   Copy the displayed secret (starting with `sk-ant-admin01-`) and store it in your secrets manager. The full secret is shown only once.

##  Create a key for a Claude Enterprise organization

1. 1

   Sign in as the primary owner or an organization owner

   The **primary owner** of the Claude Enterprise parent organization can create a key that can access every linked organization, or one restricted to a single organization. An **organization owner** can create a key with Compliance API scopes only, restricted to their own organization.
2. 2

   Open API settings

   Go to [claude.ai > Organization settings > API](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/api-access) and find the **Keys** section.
3. 3

   Click + Create key

   Name the key and select the scopes you need from the [scopes table](#choose-scopes-for-a-claude-enterprise-key). The primary owner can combine scopes from different APIs (for example, `read:analytics` and `read:spend_limits`) on a single key.
4. 4

   Copy and store the secret

   Copy the displayed secret (starting with `sk-ant-api01-`) and store it in your secrets manager. The full secret is shown only once.

##  Choose scopes for a Claude Enterprise key

When you create a Claude Enterprise key, select every scope that the APIs you plan to call require. Scopes are fixed at creation; to add a scope later, create a new key.

| To call... | Select these scopes |
| --- | --- |
| Admin API [user management](manage-claude/user-management.md): list and look up members and invites; read custom roles and their permissions | `read:members` |
| Admin API [user management](manage-claude/user-management.md): change member roles, remove members, create and withdraw invites | `write:members` |
| Admin API [user management](manage-claude/user-management.md): read groups and their members | `read:rbac_groups` |
| Admin API [user management](manage-claude/user-management.md): create, rename, and delete groups; add and remove group members; assign groups on invite creation | `write:rbac_groups` |
| [Spend Limits API](manage-claude/spend-limits-api.md): read members' effective spend limits and increase requests | `read:spend_limits` |
| [Spend Limits API](manage-claude/spend-limits-api.md): set or clear per-user spend limits; approve or deny increase requests | `write:spend_limits` |
| [Claude Enterprise Analytics API](manage-claude/analytics-api.md): engagement, adoption, cost, and usage reports | `read:analytics` |
| [Compliance API Activity Feed](manage-claude/compliance-activity-feed.md): organization-wide activity events | `read:compliance_activities` |
| [Compliance API content endpoints](manage-claude/compliance-content-data.md): read chats, files, projects, and users | `read:compliance_user_data` |
| [Compliance API content endpoints](manage-claude/compliance-content-data.md): delete chats, files, and projects | `delete:compliance_user_data` |
| [Compliance API organization endpoints](manage-claude/compliance-org-data.md): read organization metadata and effective settings | `read:compliance_org_data` |
| Admin API [user management](manage-claude/user-management.md) read endpoints and every Compliance API read endpoint, with a single read-only scope (for security-audit integrations; does not include the Spend Limits or Analytics APIs) | `read:org_audit` |

The Compliance and Analytics APIs must be enabled for your organization before keys with those scopes can be used. See [Set up the Compliance API](manage-claude/compliance-api-access.md) and [Analytics APIs](manage-claude/analytics-api.md).

##  Use the key

Pass the key in the `x-api-key` header on every request. See each API's documentation for complete request examples.

A call that exceeds the key's scopes returns `403 Forbidden` with a message listing the scopes the key has and the scopes the endpoint needs.
