

**The Admin API is unavailable for individual accounts.** To collaborate with teammates and add members, set up your organization in **Console → Settings → Organization**.

The [Admin API](api/admin.md) allows you to programmatically manage your organization's resources, including organization members, workspaces, and API keys. This provides programmatic control over administrative tasks that would otherwise require manual configuration in the [Claude Console](/).



**The Admin API requires special access**

The Admin API accepts two credentials: an Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin...`) sent in the `x-api-key` header or an OAuth bearer token with the `org:admin` scope sent in the `authorization: Bearer` header. Only organization members with the admin role can provision Admin API keys, and only members with the admin, owner, or primary owner role can obtain `org:admin` tokens. See [Create an Admin API key](manage-claude/admin-api-keys.md).



**Claude Platform on AWS:** Most of the Admin API is not available on Claude Platform on AWS. Workspace endpoints (create, get, list, update, and archive on `/v1/organizations/workspaces`) are available. Other endpoints including organization members, workspace members, invites, API keys, usage reports, cost reports, and rate limit reports are not available. See [Claude Platform on AWS](build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws.md) for details.

##  Authentication

Authenticate with either credential. To create an Admin API key for your organization type, see [Create an Admin API key](manage-claude/admin-api-keys.md). The following examples call the [organization info endpoint](#accessing-organization-info) both ways:

**OAuth bearer:**

cURL



```shiki
curl --fail-with-body -sS "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/me" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN"
```

An `org:admin` token grants access to the whole organization, regardless of the workspace the underlying profile or federation rule is bound to. To obtain one, see the prerequisites in [Manage WIF with the Admin API](manage-claude/wif-admin-api.md).

**Admin API key:**

cURL



```shiki
curl --fail-with-body -sS "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/me" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

##  How the Admin API works

When you use the Admin API:

1. You make requests using either credential from the [Authentication](#authentication) section
2. The API allows you to manage:
   - Organization members and their roles
   - Organization member invites
   - Workspaces and their members
   - API keys
   - Service accounts, federation issuers, and federation rules (these endpoints require an `org:admin` OAuth token; Admin API keys are not accepted)

This is useful for:

- Automating user onboarding/offboarding
- Programmatically managing workspace access
- Monitoring and managing API key usage

##  Organization roles and permissions

There are five organization-level roles. See more details in the [API Console roles and permissions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10186004-api-console-roles-and-permissions) article.

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| user | Can use Workbench |
| claude\_code\_user | Can use Workbench and [Claude Code](overview.md) |
| developer | Can use Workbench and manage API keys |
| billing | Can use Workbench and manage billing details |
| admin | Can do all of the preceding, plus manage users |

Organization owners and primary owners have all admin permissions and can additionally manage admins. All references to the admin role on this page also apply to owners and primary owners.

##  Key concepts

###  Organization members

You can list [organization members](api/admin-api/users/get-user.md), update member roles, and remove members.

cURL



```shiki
# List organization members
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/users?limit=10" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Update member role
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/users/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"role": "developer"}'

# Remove member
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/users/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

###  Organization invites

You can invite users to organizations and manage those [invites](api/admin-api/invites/get-invite.md).

cURL



```shiki
# Create invite
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/invites" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "email": "[email protected]",
    "role": "developer"
  }'

# List invites
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/invites?limit=10" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Delete invite
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/invites/{invite_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

###  Workspaces

For a comprehensive guide to workspaces, including Console and API examples, see [Workspaces](manage-claude/workspaces.md).

###  Workspace members

Manage [user access to specific workspaces](api/admin-api/workspace_members/get-workspace-member.md):

cURL



```shiki
# Add member to workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "user_xxx",
    "workspace_role": "workspace_developer"
  }'

# List workspace members
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members?limit=10" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Update member role
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "workspace_role": "workspace_admin"
  }'

# Remove member from workspace
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

###  API keys

Monitor and manage [API keys](api/admin/api_keys/list.md). Each key in the response includes its `expires_at` timestamp (`null` for keys without an [expiration](manage-claude/authentication.md)):

cURL



```shiki
# List API keys
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/api_keys?limit=10&status=active&workspace_id=wrkspc_xxx" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Update API key
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/api_keys/{api_key_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "status": "inactive",
    "name": "New Key Name"
  }'
```

###  Service accounts

Create and manage service accounts (`svac_...`), the non-human identities that [Workload Identity Federation](manage-claude/workload-identity-federation.md) tokens act as. Admin API keys are not accepted on the service-account, federation-issuer, or federation-rule endpoints; use an `org:admin` OAuth token. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](manage-claude/wif-admin-api.md).

###  Federation issuers

Register the OIDC identity providers (`fdis_...`) whose tokens may assert workload identity for your organization. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](manage-claude/wif-admin-api.md).

###  Federation rules

Manage the rules (`fdrl_...`) that map issuer tokens to service accounts and scopes. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](manage-claude/wif-admin-api.md).

##  Accessing organization info

Get information about your organization programmatically with the `/v1/organizations/me` endpoint.

For example:

cURL



```shiki
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/me" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

```shiki
{
  "id": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678",
  "type": "organization",
  "name": "Organization Name"
}
```



This endpoint is useful for programmatically determining which organization an Admin API key belongs to.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see the [Organization Info API reference](api/admin-api/organization/get-me.md).

##  Usage and cost reports

Track your organization's usage and costs with the [Usage and Cost API](manage-claude/usage-cost-api.md).

##  Claude Code analytics

Monitor developer productivity and Claude Code adoption with the [Claude Code Analytics API](manage-claude/claude-code-analytics-api.md).

##  Rate limits

Read the rate limits configured for your organization and its workspaces with the [Rate Limits API](manage-claude/rate-limits-api.md).

##  Compliance API

Retrieve audit and activity data for your organization with the [Compliance API](manage-claude/compliance-api.md). Admin API keys can read the Activity Feed only; for full access, see [Set up the Compliance API](manage-claude/compliance-api-access.md).

##  Best practices

To effectively use the Admin API:

- Use meaningful names and descriptions for workspaces and API keys
- Implement proper error handling for failed operations
- Regularly audit member roles and permissions
- Clean up unused workspaces and expired invites
- Monitor API key usage, audit each key's [`expires_at`](manage-claude/authentication.md), and rotate keys periodically
