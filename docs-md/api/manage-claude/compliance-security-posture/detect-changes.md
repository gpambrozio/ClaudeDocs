description: "Start from sample detection rules for Security posture activities in your SIEM: accepted risks, controls attested as Failed, unexpected editors, bursts of changes, and attestations that end automatically."
---

To enable the Compliance API, see [Set up the Compliance API](../compliance-api-access.md).

These sample rules alert on changes in your organization’s [Security posture](overview.md), using the activities that the Compliance API Activity Feed records. They assume that your security information and event management (SIEM) system stores these activities, as [Send events to your SIEM](send-events.md) describes.

## Before you write a rule

Each rule is a plain description and a query in no particular query language.

* Queries use the Activity Feed’s field names, plus `stored_at`, this page’s name for when you stored an activity. Any other name is your own list or alias.
* Before a rule counts activities, deduplicate them by `id`.
* Unless a rule says otherwise, run it over the time since its last completed run, by `stored_at`, not `created_at`, because an activity can arrive late; queries leave that range out.
* Write rules that fire on an activity you stored, never on one you have not: it may be late or a change [the feed does not record](events-reference.md#what-the-feed-does-not-record). To compare stored activities with current results, see [Check events against results](check-events-against-results.md).

## Attestation rules

These five rules read [`org_security_control_attestation_updated`](events-reference.md#attestation-activity) activities.

### A risk was accepted

Alert when someone accepts the risk (`accepted_risk`) of not meeting a security control, so that a second person can review the decision.

```sql
type == "org_security_control_attestation_updated"
AND status == "accepted_risk"
AND actor.type != "system_actor"
```

The rule leaves out a `system_actor`, because an automatic change, such as an attestation that ended (`lapsed`), keeps the `status` but is not an acceptance.

### A control was attested as Failed

Alert when someone attests to a control as Failed (`control_failed`), so that someone follows up on the control.

```sql
type == "org_security_control_attestation_updated"
AND status == "control_failed"
AND actor.type != "system_actor"
```

The rule leaves out a `system_actor` for the same reason as [A risk was accepted](detect-changes.md#a-risk-was-accepted).

### Someone outside an allowlist changed an attestation

Alert when an attestation is recorded, changed, saved again, or cleared by someone not on your list of people who manage attestations. Keep their `user_id` values (`allowed_user_ids`) in your SIEM.

```sql
type == "org_security_control_attestation_updated"
AND actor.type != "system_actor"
AND NOT (actor.type == "user_actor" AND actor.user_id IN allowed_user_ids)
```

* Any actor other than a listed `user_actor` or a `system_actor` fires the rule.
* Key the list on `actor.user_id`: `actor.email_address` is the address the person had when the activity was recorded ([Correlate with your SIEM](../compliance-integration-patterns.md#correlate-with-your-siem)).

### One person made many attestation changes

Alert when one person makes more attestation changes in a short time than is usual for your organization. The threshold of 10 and the 1-hour window are examples; choose both from your own activity.

```sql
type == "org_security_control_attestation_updated"
AND actor.type == "user_actor"
| group by organization_uuid, actor.user_id over a sliding 1 hour of created_at
| where count(distinct id) >= 10
```

* Alert only for a group that holds an activity stored since the rule’s last run, and count over every activity that you stored, so that a late activity joins a burst whose other activities you stored earlier.
* Counting by `created_at` measures the person’s pace, not your ingestion’s.

### An attestation ended automatically

Treat a `lapsed` activity as a prompt to review the control that it names.

```sql
type == "org_security_control_attestation_updated"
AND action == "lapsed"
```

A [`lapsed` activity](events-reference.md#what-a-lapsed-activity-means) means that the control’s check result or its current value differs from the one the attestation was saved on, not that an end date (`review_date`) passed. It can come late.

## Keep rules working as values change

New values can appear in any of these fields.

* Identify automatic changes by `actor.type`, not by the value of `actor.service`.
* Do not drop activities whose `control`, `action`, or `status` value a rule does not list; a new `action` value can record an acceptance. See the [events reference](events-reference.md).

## Test a rule

To see [the allowlist rule](detect-changes.md#someone-outside-an-allowlist-changed-an-attestation) fire, choose someone who can attest and who is not on your list. Have that person attest to a control that has no attestation and whose result no one relies on, then clear it. Until it is cleared, the attestation can change that control’s result. Both activities can take a while to reach the Activity Feed.

If you store these activities as Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) events, [Map Security posture events to OCSF](ocsf-mapping.md) maps their fields.
