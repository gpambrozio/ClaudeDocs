## Overview

Claude Haiku 5.5 is built for high-volume, latency-sensitive work such as classification, routing, extraction, and subagent tasks. It supports adaptive thinking with the effort parameter, a 1M token context window, and up to 128k output tokens. It uses the same newer tokenizer as Claude 4.7 and later models, so the same text counts as approximately 30% more tokens than on Claude Haiku 4.5. Its thinking blocks work only in the account that produced them, or in an account linked to it.

For code changes, see the [migration guide](migration-guide.md). For model IDs, pricing, and limits, see the [Claude Haiku 5.5 overview](overview.md). For prompting guidance, see [Prompting Claude Haiku 5.5](../../build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-haiku-5-5.md).

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :--------- | :----------------- | :------- | :------------------- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| [Claude Fable 5.1](../fable-5-1/overview.md)   | 1M      | 128K       | $10 / $50          | Slower   | Adaptive (always on) | `high`         | Jun 2026         |
| [Claude Opus 5.5](../opus-5-5/overview.md)     | 1M      | 128K       | $4 / $20           | Moderate | Adaptive (always on) | `medium`       | Jun 2026         |
| [Claude Sonnet 5.5](../sonnet-5-5/overview.md) | 1M      | 128K       | $2 / $10           | Fast     | Adaptive             | `high`         | Jun 2026         |
| **Claude Haiku 5.5** (this model)                                                   | 1M      | 128K       | From $0.10 / $0.50 | Fastest  | Adaptive             | `medium`       | Jun 2026         |

* **Context:** 1M tokens is roughly 555k words or 2.5M Unicode characters on the current tokenizer (introduced with Claude Opus 4.7); models before it fit about 750k words in 1M tokens. 200k tokens is roughly 150k words.
* **Max output:** Synchronous Messages API limit. On the Message Batches API, Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Opus 5, Claude Sonnet 5.5, Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Haiku 5.5, Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Opus 4.6, and Claude Sonnet 4.6 support up to 300k output tokens with the output-300k-2026-03-24 beta header.
* **Price / MTok:** Input / output, base price per million tokens. Batch API requests are 50% off; prompt caching reads cost 10% of the base input price (2.5% on Claude Fable 5.1 and Claude Mythos 5.1, 5% on Claude Opus 5.5 and Claude Sonnet 5.5). See Pricing for the full list.
* **Latency:** Comparative latency, relative to the current lineup, as published in the models overview. Actual latency depends on prompt length, output length, and thinking effort.
* **Thinking:** Adaptive thinking lets the model decide how much to think, steered by effort. Extended thinking is the manual budget\_tokens mode on earlier models.
* **Default effort:** The effort parameter’s default on the Claude API. Models without a value don’t support the parameter.
* **Knowledge cutoff:** Reliable knowledge cutoff: the date through which the model’s knowledge is most extensive and reliable.

## Good to know

* Adaptive thinking is on by default. Control thinking depth with the [effort parameter](../../build-with-claude/effort.md).
* Omit `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k`. See [Remove sampling parameters](migration-guide.md#remove-sampling-parameters) for the values that return a 400 error.
* On the [Message Batches API](../../build-with-claude/batch-processing.md#extended-output-beta), Claude Haiku 5.5 supports up to 300k output tokens with the `output-300k-2026-03-24` beta header.
* The minimum cacheable prompt length is 512 tokens. See [Prompt caching](../../build-with-claude/prompt-caching.md#cache-limitations).
* Query limits and capabilities programmatically with the [Models API](../../api/models/list.md).
