# Intro to Claude

Copy page



Anthropic offers two ways to build with Claude, each suited to different use cases:

|  | Messages API | Claude Managed Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What it is** | Direct model prompting access | Pre-built, configurable agent harness that runs in managed infrastructure |
| **Best for** | Custom agent loops and fine-grained control | Long-running tasks and asynchronous work |

To learn more about each, see [Using the Messages API](build-with-claude/working-with-messages.md) and the [Claude Managed Agents overview](managed-agents/overview.md).

## Explore the latest generation of Claude models

If you're unsure which model to use, start with [Claude Opus 5](models/opus-5/overview.md) for most workloads. Use [Claude Fable 5.1](models/fable-5-1/overview.md) for demanding reasoning and long-horizon agentic work, or when your evals on Claude Opus 5 at higher effort still fall short. All current models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, vision, and tool use. Each model's page lists the platforms it's available on.

## Recommended path for new developers

Follow these steps to go from zero to a working Claude integration.

1. 1

   ### Make your first API call

   Set up your environment, install an SDK, and send your first message to Claude.

   [Go to the quickstart](get-started.md)
2. 2

   ### Secure your credentials

   Set an expiration when you create your API key. Keep the key out of source control, client-side code, and prompts. Check whether your workload can use Workload Identity Federation instead of a static key.

   [Read the authentication guide](manage-claude/authentication.md)
3. 3

   ### Understand the Messages API

   Learn the core request and response structure, including multi-turn conversations, system prompts, and stop reasons.

   [Read the Messages API guide](build-with-claude/working-with-messages.md)
4. 4

   ### Choose the right model

   Compare Claude models by capability and cost to pick the best fit for your use case.

   [See the models overview](models/overview.md)
5. 5
