# Fast mode (research preview)

Copy page



Fast mode delivers up to 2.5x higher output tokens per second from Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Opus 4.7, and Claude Opus 4.6 at premium pricing. Set `speed: "fast"` with the `fast-mode-2026-02-01` beta header on your request to opt in.



Fast mode is in research preview. Contact your account manager to request access. If you do not have an account manager, [join the waitlist](https://claude.com/fast-mode) for fast mode.



This feature is eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](build-with-claude/api-and-data-retention.md). When your organization has a ZDR arrangement, data sent through this feature is not stored after the API response is returned.

##  Supported models

Fast mode is supported on the following models:

- Claude Opus 4.8 (claude-opus-4-8)
- Claude Opus 4.7 (claude-opus-4-7)
- Claude Opus 4.6 (claude-opus-4-6)



Fast mode for Claude Opus 4.8 launches as a research preview on the Claude API, including [Claude Managed Agents](managed-agents/overview.md), only. It is not available on third-party platforms, including Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Foundry.



Fast mode for Claude Opus 4.6 is deprecated as of the Claude Opus 4.8 launch and will be removed approximately 30 days later. After removal, requests to `claude-opus-4-6` with `speed: "fast"` will fall back to standard speed at standard pricing rather than return an error. Migrate to fast mode for Claude Opus 4.8 or Claude Opus 4.7 to keep the speedup.

##  How fast mode works

Fast mode runs the same model with a faster inference configuration. There is no change to intelligence or capabilities.

- Up to 2.5x higher output tokens per second compared to standard speed
- Speed benefits are focused on output tokens per second (OTPS), not time to first token (TTFT)
- Same model weights and behavior (not a different model)
- Compatible with [streaming](build-with-claude/streaming.md), where the OTPS gain is most visible

##  Basic usage

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=4096,
    speed="fast",
    betas=["fast-mode-2026-02-01"],
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Refactor this module to use dependency injection"}
    ],
)

print(response.content[0].text)
```

##  Pricing

Fast mode is priced at a per-model multiplier on standard rates across the full context window, including requests over 200k input tokens. The following table shows fast mode pricing for each supported model:

| Model | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | $10 / MTok | $50 / MTok |
| Claude Opus 4.7 / Claude Opus 4.6 | $30 / MTok | $150 / MTok |

Fast mode pricing stacks with other pricing modifiers:

- [Prompt caching multipliers](about-claude/pricing.md) apply on top of fast mode pricing
- [Data residency](manage-claude/data-residency.md) multipliers apply on top of fast mode pricing

For complete pricing details, see the [pricing page](about-claude/pricing.md).

##  Rate limits

Fast mode has a dedicated rate limit that is separate from standard Opus rate limits. When your fast mode rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a `429` error with a `retry-after` header indicating when capacity will be available.

The response includes headers that indicate your fast mode rate limit status:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `anthropic-fast-input-tokens-limit` | Maximum fast mode input tokens per minute |
| `anthropic-fast-input-tokens-remaining` | Remaining fast mode input tokens |
| `anthropic-fast-input-tokens-reset` | Time when the fast mode input token limit resets |
| `anthropic-fast-output-tokens-limit` | Maximum fast mode output tokens per minute |
| `anthropic-fast-output-tokens-remaining` | Remaining fast mode output tokens |
| `anthropic-fast-output-tokens-reset` | Time when the fast mode output token limit resets |

For tier-specific rate limits, see the [rate limits page](api/rate-limits.md).

##  Checking which speed was used

The response `usage` object includes a `speed` field that indicates which speed was used, either `"fast"` or `"standard"`. Fast mode doesn't silently fall back to standard speed on rate limits or capacity (you'll get a `429` or `529` instead), so when you request `speed: "fast"` on a supported model, `usage.speed` is `"fast"`.

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",

    speed="fast",
    betas=["fast-mode-2026-02-01"],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)

print(response.usage.speed)  # "fast" or "standard"
```

  }
}
```

##  Retries and fallback

###  Automatic retries

When fast mode rate limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429` error with a `retry-after` header. The Anthropic SDKs automatically retry these requests up to 2 times by default (configurable with `max_retries`), waiting for the server-specified delay before each retry. Because fast mode uses continuous token replenishment, the `retry-after` delay is typically short and requests succeed once capacity is available.

###  Falling back to standard speed

If you'd prefer to fall back to standard speed rather than wait for fast mode capacity, catch the rate limit error and retry without `speed: "fast"`. Set `max_retries` to `0` on the initial fast request to skip automatic retries and fail immediately on rate limit errors.



Falling back from fast to standard speed will result in a [prompt cache](build-with-claude/prompt-caching.md) miss. Requests at different speeds do not share cached prefixes.

Because setting `max_retries` to `0` also disables retries for other transient errors (overloaded, internal server errors), the following examples reissue the original request with default retries for those cases.

```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

def create_message_with_fast_fallback(max_retries=0, max_attempts=3, **params):
    try:
        return client.with_options(max_retries=max_retries).beta.messages.create(
            **params
        )
    except anthropic.RateLimitError:
        if params.get("speed") == "fast":
            del params["speed"]
            return create_message_with_fast_fallback(max_retries=max_retries, **params)
        raise
    except (
        anthropic.APIStatusError,
        anthropic.APIConnectionError,
    ) as error:
        if isinstance(error, anthropic.APIStatusError) and error.status_code < 500:
            raise
        if max_attempts > 1:
            return create_message_with_fast_fallback(
                max_retries=max_retries, max_attempts=max_attempts - 1, **params
            )
        raise

message = create_message_with_fast_fallback(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    betas=["fast-mode-2026-02-01"],
    speed="fast",
    max_retries=0,
)
```

##  Considerations

- **Prompt caching:** Switching between fast and standard speed invalidates the prompt cache. Requests at different speeds do not share cached prefixes.
- **Supported models:** Fast mode is supported on Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Opus 4.7, and Claude Opus 4.6. Sending `speed: "fast"` with an unsupported model returns an error.
- **TTFT:** Fast mode's benefits are focused on output tokens per second (OTPS), not time to first token (TTFT).
- **Batch API:** Fast mode is not available with the [Batch API](build-with-claude/batch-processing.md).
- **Priority Tier:** Fast mode is not available with a [Priority Tier](api/service-tiers.md) commitment.
- **Claude Platform on AWS:** Fast mode is not currently available on [Claude Platform on AWS](build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws.md).
