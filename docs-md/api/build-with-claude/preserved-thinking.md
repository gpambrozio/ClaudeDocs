# Preserved thinking

Copy page



Preserved thinking is a property of newer Claude models that guards against distillation. It decides whether the model can use a thinking block that you send back from an earlier turn. Starting with Claude Fable 5.1, when a `thinking` or `redacted_thinking` block comes back in a request, the API checks the block's `signature` for two things:

- **The model is the one that produced the block, or a newer one.** A model reads its own thinking blocks and those of earlier models. Claude Fable 5.1 reads blocks from Claude Opus 5, but Claude Opus 5 can't read blocks from Claude Fable 5.1. If the current model can't read a block, the API drops it from that request without an error. See [Switching models mid-conversation](#switching-models).
- **Nothing before the thinking block has changed.** The top-level `system` prompt, `tools`, and `messages` before the block are its prefix. If the prefix differs from what you sent when the block was produced, that block and every later thinking block are invalid, and the API rejects the request with a 400 error or drops the invalid blocks, whichever you choose. See [Keeping the prefix unchanged](#prefix-check).

The model check applies to every account. The API enforces the prefix check by default for accounts created on or after August 31, 2026, 00:00 UTC. On older accounts, it enforces the prefix check only on requests that set `thinking.block_binding.prefix_mismatch_behavior`. **Later models will enforce the prefix check for all accounts**, so make your integration append-only now.

## Switching models mid-conversation

Claude Fable 5.1 and Claude Mythos 5.1 read thinking blocks produced by each other and by earlier Claude models. No earlier model reads thinking blocks from Claude Fable 5.1 or Claude Mythos 5.1.

- **A conversation that moves up to Claude Fable 5.1 keeps its reasoning.** The earlier model's thinking blocks stay readable, so the model thinks as usual from the first turn after the switch.
- **A conversation that moves down to an earlier model loses Claude Fable 5.1's reasoning for that request.** This happens when a router sends a turn to a cheaper model, after a [classifier refusal fallback](build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback.md), or during a [server-side fallback](build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback.md). The API removes the unreadable blocks before the prompt reaches the model. They aren't billed and don't count toward `input_tokens`.

Keep sending the full history on every request, thinking blocks included, and let the API drop what the current model can't read. The API never edits your `messages` array, so the dropped blocks stay in your history. When the same history goes back to Claude Fable 5.1, its blocks are readable again, along with the earlier model's thinking. The reasoning is lost for good only if your client removes the blocks itself, for example a harness that strips thinking on a model switch or rebuilds the history from what each model used.

![Animation: switching to Claude Opus skips Claude Fable 5.1's thinking for that turn; switching back, everything is read again](/docs/images/preserved-thinking-model-switch.gif)

With the `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` [beta header](api/beta-headers.md), the response lists each dropped block in a top-level `input_transformations` array with `reason: "model_binding_mismatch"`:

```shiki
{
  "input_transformations": [
    {
      "type": "thinking_dropped",
      "path": "messages.3.content.0",
      "reason": "model_binding_mismatch"
    }
  ]
}
```



Without the header, the drop is silent. This entry isn't a bug in your integration, and `prefix_mismatch_behavior` has no effect on it: a block the current model can't read is always dropped.

## Keeping the prefix unchanged

On Claude Fable 5.1, a thinking block stays valid only while everything you sent before it is unchanged on later requests. The checked prefix has three parts:

- The top-level `system` prompt
- The set of `tools`
- Every `message` before the block

Note: With server-side [compaction](build-with-claude/compaction.md), the checked prefix starts at the most recent compaction block.

Request parameters outside those three fields, such as `effort`, `max_tokens`, `output_config`, `tool_choice`, and `metadata`, aren't part of the prefix check, and neither are `cache_control` markers. [What counts as an edit](#what-counts-as-an-edit) has the full list.

Earlier thinking blocks aren't in the prefix, but each thinking block records which thinking block came before it, across turns. You can remove thinking blocks from the front of the history, oldest first. Removing one from the middle invalidates thinking blocks after it.

Keep `system` and `tools` fixed for the session and treat `messages` as append-only. The same discipline keeps the prefix stable for [prompt caching](build-with-claude/prompt-caching.md): the edits that invalidate thinking are the edits that restart the cache.

### What the API does with an invalid block

You choose with `thinking.block_binding.prefix_mismatch_behavior`:

- **`"error"` (the default):** the API rejects the request with a 400 `invalid_request_error` that names the first failing block.
- **`"drop_block"`:** the API drops each failing block and every thinking block after it, and the request succeeds. Dropped blocks aren't billed. The model answers that turn without using reasoning from dropped blocks, and the prompt cache restarts at the edit. The response lists each dropped block in `input_transformations` (on the `message_start` event when streaming) with `reason: "prefix_binding_mismatch"`.

Both the field and the `input_transformations` array require the `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` [beta header](api/beta-headers.md). [Set the mismatch behavior and read `input_transformations`](#preserved-thinking-controls) shows the request in each SDK.

The 400 message begins:

```block
messages.1.content.0: Invalid `signature` in `thinking` block. The block is bound to a different conversation. Remove the block, or set `thinking.block_binding.prefix_mismatch_behavior` to "drop_block".
```



If the request didn't send the beta header, the message continues:

```shiki
That setting requires the `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` value in the `anthropic-beta` header.
```



It usually ends with a sentence naming what changed, for example that the `system` prompt or the `tools` list differs from when the block was created. See [Troubleshooting thinking](build-with-claude/thinking-troubleshooting.md) for every variant of this error.

If you hit this 400 in production, retrying the same body fails the same way. Retry with the beta header and `prefix_mismatch_behavior: "drop_block"` and keep sending it for the rest of the session, or strip every `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` block from the history yourself and retry once. Then fix the edit that caused the mismatch. In the Message Batches API, an item that leaves the field unset drops failing blocks instead of erroring, so set `"error"` explicitly there if you want batch items to fail.

A tampered or undecryptable signature is a different failure. It always returns a 400 (`` Invalid `signature` in `thinking` block `` with no sentence about the conversation), and `prefix_mismatch_behavior` doesn't apply to it.

### Set the mismatch behavior and read `input_transformations`

The `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` [beta header](api/beta-headers.md) adds:

- A top-level `input_transformations` array on every response
- A `block_binding` object on the `thinking` configuration, whose one field is `prefix_mismatch_behavior`

`block_binding` is accepted alongside `thinking.type: "adaptive"` and `thinking.type: "enabled"`. Sending it without the beta header returns a 400 error. Models that don't run the prefix check accept the object and report only model-check drops, so one request body works across models.

The following request opts into dropping rather than rejecting. On a first turn there's nothing to replay, so `input_transformations` comes back empty:

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-fable-5-1",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "adaptive",
        "block_binding": {"prefix_mismatch_behavior": "drop_block"},
    },
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the greatest common divisor of 1071 and 462?",
        }
    ],
    betas=["thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01"],
)

for block in response.content:
    if block.type == "text":
        print(block.text)

print(f"Input transformations: {len(response.input_transformations or [])}")
```

Output



```block
The greatest common divisor of 1071 and 462 is 21.
Input transformations: 0
```

Under the beta header, every response from a thinking-capable model carries `input_transformations`. It's empty when nothing was dropped. Each entry has `type: "thinking_dropped"`, the `path` of the dropped block (for example `messages.1.content.0`), and a `reason` of `prefix_binding_mismatch` or `model_binding_mismatch` (see [Switching models mid-conversation](#switching-models)). Ignore entries whose `type` or `reason` you don't recognize, because later checks add values.

When [streaming](build-with-claude/streaming.md), the array arrives on the `message` object in the `message_start` event. After a mid-stream server-side fallback, the final `message_delta` event carries it again with the serving model's entries. In a [message batch](build-with-claude/batch-processing.md), an item whose block fails the prefix check under an explicit `"error"` resolves as `errored`, and an item that leaves the field unset drops the failing blocks instead. The [token counting](build-with-claude/token-counting.md) endpoint runs the same prefix check and returns the same 400.

### When the API enforces the check

The prefix check runs on Claude Fable 5.1 for new accounts.

- **Accounts created on or after August 31, 2026, 00:00 UTC:** the API checks Claude Fable 5.1 requests and applies `"error"` unless you set `"drop_block"`. The same definition of a new account applies to the Claude API and to cloud platforms.
- **Older accounts:** the API checks requests that set `prefix_mismatch_behavior`. This parameter opts a request in, so you can see what a new account sees without creating one.
- **Later models:** every account, on every request.

To find out which group your account is in, take a Claude Fable 5.1 conversation that contains a thinking block, change something before that block, and send it to Claude Fable 5.1 without the beta header or the `block_binding` field. A 400 response that names the header means your account is enforced by default.

### What counts as an edit

Each row compares two consecutive requests:

| Change between requests | Later thinking blocks |
| --- | --- |
| Append messages at the end | Valid |
| Add a tool with `defer_loading: true` that nothing has referenced yet | Valid |
| Remove `thinking` blocks from the start of the history | Valid |
| Change any request parameter outside `system`, `tools`, and `messages` (`effort`, `max_tokens`, `output_config`, `tool_choice`, `metadata`, and so on) | Valid |
| Add, move, or remove `cache_control` markers | Valid |
| A rotating signed URL that returns the same bytes | Valid |
| Server-side compaction or context editing removes or replaces content | Valid (the check compares what you sent, not the server's edited copy) |
| A cleared [turn-scoped system message](#per-turn-reminders) left in place | Valid |
| Edit, reorder, or delete any earlier `user`, `assistant`, or `system` message | Invalid |
| Add a text block to an earlier user turn, or remove one you added last time | Invalid |
| Change the top-level `system` string or blocks | Invalid |
| Add, remove, rename, or edit a tool in `tools` | Invalid |
| Remove a `thinking` block from the middle of the history and keep later ones | Invalid for every later thinking block |
| An image or document URL that returns different bytes on the next request | Invalid |
| The same turn-scoped message deleted or reworded on a later request | Invalid |

### Check whether your code edits the prefix

First, diff what you send. Capture the request bodies your integration sends over a few normal turns, including a compaction or a tool change. For each pair of consecutive requests, compare `system`, `tools`, and the `messages` they share. They should be identical up to the newly appended turns.

Then confirm against the API. Add the `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` beta header, set `prefix_mismatch_behavior` to `"drop_block"`, and run a normal multi-turn session through your integration on claude-fable-5-1. The following example runs two turns the way your integration should: `messages` only grows, each assistant turn goes back exactly as the API returned it, `thinking` blocks included, and `block_binding` is set on every request. It prints the number of dropped blocks after each turn:

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# messages grows across turns: each assistant turn goes back exactly as returned
messages = []
for user_turn in ["What is 27 * 453?", "Now divide that result by 3."]:
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_turn})
    response = client.beta.messages.create(
        model="claude-fable-5-1",
        max_tokens=16000,
        thinking={
            "type": "adaptive",
            "block_binding": {"prefix_mismatch_behavior": "drop_block"},
        },
        messages=messages,
        betas=["thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01"],
    )
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
    print(len(response.input_transformations or []))
```

Output



```block
0
0
```

Both turns print `0` because nothing earlier changed. Log `input_transformations` on every turn of your own integration. When the API drops a block, the entry looks like the following:

```shiki
{
  "input_transformations": [
    {
      "type": "thinking_dropped",
      "path": "messages.1.content.0",
      "reason": "prefix_binding_mismatch"
    }
  ]
}
```



- **Empty on every turn:** your integration keeps the prefix intact.
- **`reason: "prefix_binding_mismatch"`:** something before the block at `path` changed since the previous request. Diff `system`, `tools`, and `messages` up to that turn to find it, then find the matching replacement in [Make changes without editing the prefix](#replace-prefix-edits).
- **`reason: "model_binding_mismatch"`:** the conversation moved to a model that can't read the earlier model's blocks. This isn't a prefix edit. See [Switching models mid-conversation](#switching-models).

To fail loudly in CI instead, set `"error"` and treat the 400 described in [What the API does with an invalid block](#mismatch-behavior) as a test failure.

## Make changes without editing the prefix

Each common prefix edit has a replacement that gives the model the same information and leaves earlier bytes unchanged, so later thinking stays valid. Find the edit your code makes today in the first column:

| Instead of | Use | Beta header |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rebuilding the top-level `system` prompt | A [mid-conversation system message](#new-instructions) | None |
| Injecting a reminder and deleting it on the next request | A [turn-scoped system message](#per-turn-reminders) (`clear_at: "next_user_message"`) | `mid-conversation-system-clear-at-2026-08-21` |
| Adding or removing entries in `tools` | [`tool_addition` and `tool_removal` blocks](#tool-changes) | `mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01` |
| Changing top-level `output_config.effort` (restarts the cache, doesn't affect thinking) | A [per-message `output_config`](#effort-changes) | `mid-conversation-output-config-2026-07-01` |
| Dropping or summarizing old turns on the client | Server-side [compaction or context editing](#server-side-trimming), or [client-side compaction](#custom-compaction-on-the-client) that keeps no stale thinking | `compact-2026-01-12` or `context-management-2025-06-27` |
| An image or document URL whose bytes change between requests | A [`file_id` from the Files API](#files-by-id), or base64 | None |

All of these assume you [send assistant turns back exactly as returned](#append-assistant-turns-exactly-as-returned). To use several betas in one request, combine the values in one `anthropic-beta` header. The same names apply on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud (see [Beta headers](api/beta-headers.md)):

```block
anthropic-beta: thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01,mid-conversation-system-clear-at-2026-08-21,mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01
```



### Send assistant turns back exactly as returned

Store the `content` array from each response and send it back unchanged as the assistant turn: every block type, in the order received, including `thinking` blocks whose `thinking` field is empty. A serializer that drops unknown block types, drops empty fields, or reorders blocks edits the prefix for every later turn.

### Add instructions with a mid-conversation system message

Some harnesses rebuild the top-level `system` prompt on each request to carry the current time, a token budget, a mode flag, or newly discovered project context. That invalidates every thinking block in the conversation. Instead, freeze `system` at session start. When something changes, append a [`role: "system"` message](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md) at the point in `messages` where the change becomes true:

```shiki
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "The user switched the workspace to read-only mode. Do not write files until told otherwise."
}
```



The model treats this message with system-prompt authority, and everything before it stays unchanged. In a tool loop, place the message after the `tool_result` user message, never between an assistant `tool_use` and its `tool_result` (see [Limitations](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md)). Once sent, the message is part of the prefix for later thinking: leave it in place on later requests.

### Send per-turn reminders as turn-scoped system messages

The most common prefix edit is the per-turn nudge: a line such as "request independent reads together" or "you haven't updated the user in a while" that your code appends after each batch of tool results. To keep reminders from piling up, send each nudge as a [mid-conversation system message](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md) with `clear_at: "next_user_message"`, placed after the `tool_result` user message. `clear_at` requires the beta header `mid-conversation-system-clear-at-2026-08-21`. The following `messages` array is the request after two tool calls and their results. `messages[3]` is the previous request's nudge, left in place, and `messages[6]` is this request's copy:

```shiki
[
  { "role": "user", "content": "Fix the failing test." },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      { "type": "thinking", "thinking": "", "signature": "..." },
      {
        "type": "tool_use",
        "id": "toolu_01",
        "name": "read_file",
        "input": { "path": "tests/test_auth.py" }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [{ "type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_01", "content": "..." }]
  },
  {
    "role": "system",
    "clear_at": "next_user_message",
    "content": "Request every independent read in one turn."
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      { "type": "thinking", "thinking": "", "signature": "..." },
      {
        "type": "tool_use",
        "id": "toolu_02",
        "name": "read_file",
        "input": { "path": "src/auth.py" }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [{ "type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_02", "content": "..." }]
  },
  {
    "role": "system",
    "clear_at": "next_user_message",
    "content": "Request every independent read in one turn."
  }
]
```



A user message that contains only `tool_result` blocks counts as the "next user message", so `messages[3]` is already cleared. It adds nothing to what the model sees and costs no input tokens, but because it's still in the array, the thinking in `messages[4]` stays valid. `messages[6]` is the copy the model sees this turn. On later requests, keep both where they are and append a fresh copy after the next `tool_result` message.

### Add or remove tools with `tool_addition` and `tool_removal`

Editing the `tools` array mid-session invalidates preserved thinking blocks. Instead, declare every tool the session might need in `tools` on the first request and never change the array. To change which tools the model can use from some point on, append a `role: "system"` message that carries a `tool_removal` or `tool_addition` block. These are [mid-conversation tool changes](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md) and need the beta header `mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01`. For example, to withdraw a dangerous tool after a mode switch:

```shiki
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": [
    { "type": "tool_removal", "tool": { "type": "tool_reference", "name": "delete_branch" } },
    { "type": "text", "text": "Branch deletion is disabled for the rest of this session." }
  ]
}
```



To offer a tool later instead, declare it in `tools` with `defer_loading: true` so the model doesn't see it at first. When it becomes available, append a `tool_addition` block:

```shiki
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": [
    { "type": "tool_addition", "tool": { "type": "tool_reference", "name": "deploy" } },
    { "type": "text", "text": "Authentication succeeded. Deployment is now available." }
  ]
}
```



Sometimes you can't declare a tool up front because you don't know its schema yet. An MCP server discovered at runtime is the common case. Append that tool to `tools` with `defer_loading: true`, then offer it with a `tool_addition` block. Adding a deferred tool is safe: the prefix check ignores a deferred tool until a `tool_addition` block references it, so earlier thinking stays valid. Adding a tool without `defer_loading: true` changes the prefix and invalidates earlier thinking.

The `role: "system"` messages that carry these blocks join the prefix for later thinking. Leave them in place on later requests.

### Change effort with a per-message `output_config`

Changing top-level `output_config.effort` between requests doesn't invalidate thinking, because effort isn't part of the prefix. Changing top-level effort does restart the prompt cache. On Claude Fable 5.1, use [per-message effort](build-with-claude/effort.md) instead: append a `role: "system"` message with empty `content` and the new level. It needs the beta header `mid-conversation-output-config-2026-07-01`.

```shiki
{ "role": "system", "content": [], "output_config": { "effort": "low" } }
```



The new level takes effect from the next `user` turn. Once sent, the message is part of `messages` and therefore part of the prefix for later thinking: leave it in place on later requests, and append another one to change effort again.

### Trim context on the server

The second most common prefix edit is client-side trimming: dropping or summarizing the oldest turns and keeping the recent ones verbatim. The kept turns' thinking blocks were produced while the removed history was still in place, so they fail the check. The server-side equivalents don't count as edits, because the check compares the conversation as you sent it:

- [Compaction](build-with-claude/compaction.md) summarizes older turns into a compaction block when the context approaches a threshold you set, and the checked prefix restarts from that block. Its [`instructions` parameter](build-with-claude/compaction.md) takes your own summarization prompt, such as "preserve every ticker, position size, and stated assumption".
- [Context editing](build-with-claude/context-editing.md) clears old tool results or old thinking blocks by rule, oldest first. The strategies are `clear_tool_uses_20250919` and `clear_thinking_20251015`.

### Compact on the client

You can still compact on the client. Once you rewrite anything earlier in the conversation, don't send back a thinking block that was produced before the rewrite.

#### Simple compaction (recommended)

When the conversation grows too long, summarize the whole session into one user message and send only that message plus the next instruction. Nothing earlier is replayed, so there's no thinking left to fail the check, and the model reasons afresh from the summary.

![Simple compaction: request 4 sends the full history with thinking on each assistant turn; request 5 sends one user message holding a summary of turns 1 to 4 plus the next instruction, so no earlier thinking is sent and nothing is checked](/docs/images/preserved-thinking-simple-compaction.svg)

```shiki
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "<summary of the session so far>\n\n<the next instruction>"
  }
]
```



Claude models are trained on long-horizon tasks with this scheme and for most workloads it performs well.

#### Keep-tail compaction

Keep-tail compaction summarizes the older turns and keeps the most recent turns verbatim, so the model still sees the last few exchanges word for word. As usually written it breaks the rule: the kept assistant turns still carry thinking blocks that were produced when the original turns, not the summary, came before them. Those blocks fail.

![Keep-tail compaction: the history is replaced by a summary of turns 1 and 2 followed by turns 3 to 5 verbatim; the thinking on assistant turns 3 and 4 was produced after the original turns, not the summary, so it fails; the same request sent with prefix_mismatch_behavior drop_block succeeds, the API drops those two blocks and lists them in input_transformations](/docs/images/preserved-thinking-keep-tail-compaction.svg)

Fix: keep the turns exactly as they are and send `prefix_mismatch_behavior: "drop_block"`. The API drops the stale thinking blocks, the model reads the kept turns' `text` and `tool_use` blocks, and the request succeeds.

Pass the compacted history as `messages` and set `block_binding` on the `thinking` configuration. In the following example, `compacted_messages` is the array your compaction step produced: the summary message followed by the kept turns exactly as the API returned them, `thinking` blocks included:

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# compacted_messages: the summary message, then the kept turns as returned
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-fable-5-1",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "adaptive",
        "block_binding": {"prefix_mismatch_behavior": "drop_block"},
    },
    messages=compacted_messages,
    betas=["thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01"],
)

print(response.input_transformations)
```

The response carries the new assistant turn as usual, plus one `input_transformations` entry per dropped block. For the history in the diagram, that's the thinking on assistant turns 3 and 4:

```shiki
{
  "input_transformations": [
    {
      "type": "thinking_dropped",
      "path": "messages.2.content.0",
      "reason": "prefix_binding_mismatch"
    },
    {
      "type": "thinking_dropped",
      "path": "messages.4.content.0",
      "reason": "prefix_binding_mismatch"
    }
  ]
}
```



Keep sending `"drop_block"` on later requests for as long as those two turns stay in the history. Thinking the model produces from this request onward follows the summary and stays valid. If you'd rather not depend on the beta header, the alternative is to strip the `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks from the kept assistant turns yourself when you build the compacted history.

#### Patterns that don't work with preserved thinking

- **Background compaction.** Building the summary off the critical path and swapping it in a few requests later breaks the rule the same way keep-tail does, with a delay: every assistant turn produced while the summary was being built carries thinking that predates the swap, and it all fails the moment the summary lands. If you need it, treat the swap like keep-tail and send `"drop_block"` from the swap onward. Otherwise compact synchronously.
- **Cutting turns out of the middle.** Removing individual turns invalidates every thinking block after them, and no compaction scheme avoids that. If you were cutting a turn to change an instruction, append a [mid-conversation system message](#new-instructions) instead. To remove old tool results or old thinking selectively, use server-side [context editing](build-with-claude/context-editing.md).
- **Compacting in the middle of a tool round.** Don't compact between an assistant turn's `tool_use` and the `tool_result` that answers it. Send that assistant turn back with its thinking intact so the model finishes the round with its reasoning. See [Preserving thinking blocks](build-with-claude/thinking.md).

### Reference files by ID, not by a URL whose content changes

For an `image` or `document` block with a `url` source, the check covers the fetched bytes, not the URL string. A URL whose content changes invalidates later thinking: a "latest screenshot" endpoint, or a document someone edits between turns. A rotating signed URL for the same file doesn't. For content you reference across turns, upload it once with the [Files API](build-with-claude/files.md) and use the `file_id`, or send base64.

## FAQ

### Do I need a new account to test preserved thinking?

No. Send the `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` beta header and set `thinking.block_binding.prefix_mismatch_behavior`. Setting the field opts that request into enforcement regardless of account age. `"error"` rejects an edited history with the same 400 a new account gets, and `"drop_block"` lets the request through and lists what was dropped in `input_transformations`. See [Check whether your code edits the prefix](#how-to-tell-whether-your-integration-is-impacted).

### If anything before a thinking block changes, even one tool description, is the conversation unusable?

No. What fails is the thinking already in the history after the point you changed, and you choose what happens to it. With `prefix_mismatch_behavior: "drop_block"`, the API drops those blocks and the request succeeds: the model answers that turn without that reasoning, and the prompt cache restarts at the edit. With the default `"error"`, the API rejects the request with a 400 until you undo the edit or resend with `"drop_block"`. See [What the API does with an invalid block](#mismatch-behavior). [What counts as an edit](#what-counts-as-an-edit) lists which changes matter.

### Does changing effort or other thinking settings between requests invalidate earlier thinking?

No. `output_config.effort`, `max_tokens`, and the `thinking` configuration aren't part of the checked prefix, which covers only `system`, `tools`, and `messages`. A top-level effort change invalidates most of the prompt cache. On Claude Fable 5.1, a [per-message effort](#effort-changes) change keeps the prompt cache and is used as the new effort level until changed again.

### My tool list changes mid-session. How do I avoid invalidating the conversation?

Don't edit `tools`. Declare the full set at session start, mark tools that aren't available yet with `defer_loading: true`, and offer or withdraw them with `tool_addition` and `tool_removal` blocks. If you learn a tool's schema only mid-session, such as from an MCP server discovered at runtime, you can still append it to `tools` with `defer_loading: true` and offer it the same way. That's safe because an unreferenced deferred tool isn't part of the prefix. The `role: "system"` messages that carry these blocks join the prefix for later thinking, so don't move, reword, or delete them afterward. See [Add or remove tools with `tool_addition` and `tool_removal`](#tool-changes).

### I compact by summarizing older turns and keeping recent turns verbatim. Does that still work?

Not if the kept turns still carry their thinking: those blocks were produced against the history you replaced, so they fail the check. Strip `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks from the turns you carry across and keep their `text` and `tool_use` blocks, or send `prefix_mismatch_behavior: "drop_block"` and let the API drop them. Simple compaction leaves no thinking behind to fail and is the recommended approach: one summary message plus the next user turn, with no earlier turns replayed. Server-side [compaction](build-with-claude/compaction.md) and [context editing](build-with-claude/context-editing.md) don't count as edits. See [Compact on the client](#custom-compaction-on-the-client).

### How do I handle instruction files such as AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md that change mid-session?

Load them once at session start and keep the top-level `system` prompt and `tools` fixed. When a file changes, append the new version at that point in `messages` instead of editing the original. Use a [mid-conversation system message](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md) for instructions that come from you as the operator. For file text you treat as untrusted, which shouldn't carry system-prompt authority, put the content in the next `user` turn instead. See [Add instructions with a mid-conversation system message](#new-instructions) and [Limitations](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md).

### Can I resume a saved session later, after a restart or the next day?

Yes. A resumed session is an ordinary follow-up request: `system`, `tools`, and the earlier `messages` must match what you last sent byte-for-byte. Persist exactly what you sent and received, and replay that: the rendered system prompt, the tool definitions, and each assistant turn as returned. Don't re-render from inputs that might have changed since, such as the date, an updated instruction file, or a new tool version. Anything new goes in an appended message. See [Send assistant turns back exactly as returned](#append-assistant-turns-exactly-as-returned).

### My harness can route a turn to a non-Claude model. Do those turns invalidate Claude's earlier thinking?

No, provided they're appended after the existing history and nothing earlier changes: an assistant message without thinking blocks is an appended message like any other. Send the other model's output as `text` and `tool_use` content.

### Can I carry a conversation's reasoning into a new conversation?

Not into a different conversation. A thinking block is usable only when it follows the exact `system`, `tools`, and `messages` it was produced from. A branch that replays that history unchanged up to the fork point keeps its thinking. A conversation that starts from anything else can't use it, so start that conversation from a summary of the task state, as in [simple compaction](#custom-compaction-on-the-client): the goal, decisions made, files and results so far, and the next step.
