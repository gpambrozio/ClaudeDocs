# Using the Messages API

Copy page



Anthropic offers two ways to build with Claude, each suited to different use cases:

|  | Messages API | Claude Managed Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What it is** | Direct model prompting access | Pre-built, configurable agent harness that runs in managed infrastructure |
| **Best for** | Custom agent loops and fine-grained control | Long-running tasks and asynchronous work |
| **Learn more** | [Messages API docs](build-with-claude/working-with-messages.md) | [Claude Managed Agents docs](managed-agents/overview.md) |

This guide covers common patterns for working with the Messages API, including basic requests, multi-turn conversations, prefill techniques, and vision capabilities. For complete API specifications, see the [Messages API reference](api/messages/create.md).

##  Basic request and response

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}],
)
print(message)
```

Output



```shiki
{
  "id": "msg_01XFDUDYJgAACzvnptvVoYEL",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Hello!"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-opus-5",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 12,
    "output_tokens": 6
  }
}
```

Refusal responses (`stop_reason: "refusal"`) also include a `stop_details` object identifying the policy category that triggered the refusal, on every model. See [Handling stop reasons](build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback.md) for the field reference and example handling code.

##  Multiple conversational turns

The Messages API is stateless, which means that you always send the full conversational history to the API. You can use this pattern to build up a conversation over time. Earlier conversational turns don't necessarily need to actually originate from Claude. You can use synthetic `assistant` messages.

```shiki
message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you describe LLMs to me?"},
    ],
)
print(message)
```

Output



```shiki
{
  "id": "msg_018gCsTGsXkYJVqYPxTgDHBU",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Sure, I'd be happy to provide..."
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-opus-5",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 30,
    "output_tokens": 309
  }
}
```

###  System role in messages

On Claude Fable 5, [Claude Mythos 5](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), Claude Opus 4.8, and Claude Opus 5, you can include messages with `"role": "system"` after a user turn (subject to [placement rules](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md)) to add a new system instruction partway through a conversation. A `system` message cannot be the first entry in `messages`; use the top-level `system` field for instructions that apply from the start.

A mid-conversation system message has the same authority as the top-level `system` field, but because it is appended to the end of the message history, it does not invalidate any cached prefix that came before it. Use the top-level `system` field for instructions that should apply from the very first turn, and a mid-conversation system message for instructions that only become relevant later.

See [Mid-conversation system messages](build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages.md) for the complete guide, including how to combine it with [prompt caching](build-with-claude/prompt-caching.md).

##  Prefilling Claude's response

You can pre-fill part of Claude's response in the last position of the input messages list. Use this technique to shape Claude's response. The following example uses `"max_tokens": 1` to get a single multiple choice answer from Claude.

```shiki
message = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is latin for Ant? (A) Apoidea, (B) Rhopalocera, (C) Formicidae",
        },
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is ("},
    ],
)
print(message)
```

Output



```shiki
{
  "id": "msg_01Q8Faay6S7QPTvEUUQARt7h",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "C"
    }
  ],
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "max_tokens",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 42,
    "output_tokens": 1
  }
}
```

##  Vision

Claude can read both text and images in requests. You can supply images using the `base64`, `url`, or `file` source types. The `file` source type references an image uploaded through the [Files API](build-with-claude/files.md). Supported media types are `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp`. See the [vision guide](build-with-claude/vision.md) for more details.

image_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image_url).content).decode("utf-8")

Here's what it contains:\n\n**Sky & Sun:**\n- A warm gradient sky transitioning from golden-yellow at the top to deep orange toward the horizon\n- A large pale yellow sun positioned in the upper-right area\n\n**Birds:**\n- Three small silhouetted birds flying in the upper-left portion of the sky, depicted as simple \"M\" or \"v\" shapes\n\n**Mountains:**\n- Multiple layered mountain peaks in purple and maroon tones\n- The mountains overlap to create depth, with varying shades of dusty purple and deep burgundy\n\n**Water:**\n- A dark purple body of water at the bottom of the image\n- A reflection of the sun shown as horizontal cream/peach colored lines in the center-bottom area\n\nThe overall style is clean, geometric, and uses a warm sunset color palette (oranges, yellows, purples, and maroons), giving it a peaceful, serene aesthetic typical of modern vector/flat design artwork."
