# Stop reasons and fallback

Copy page



Every Messages API response includes a `stop_reason` field that tells you why Claude stopped generating. Check this field to decide whether to use the response as-is, continue the conversation, retry, or fall back to another model.

For the full response schema, see the [Messages API reference](api/messages/create.md).

##  Quick reference

| Value | When it occurs | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`end_turn`](#end-turn) | Claude finished its response naturally. | Use the response. |
| [`max_tokens`](#max-tokens) | The response reached your `max_tokens` limit. | Raise `max_tokens` or [continue the response](#ensuring-complete-responses). |
| [`stop_sequence`](#stop-sequence) | Claude emitted one of your `stop_sequences`. | Read `stop_sequence` to see which one fired. |
| [`tool_use`](#tool-use) | Claude is calling a tool. | Run the tool and return the result. A server tool call still missing its result block completes in a later response. |
| [`pause_turn`](#pause-turn) | A server-tool loop reached its iteration limit. | Send the assistant content back to continue. |
| [`refusal`](#refusal) | Claude declined to respond. | Read `stop_details` and [retry on a fallback model](build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback.md). |
| [`model_context_window_exceeded`](#model-context-window-exceeded) | The response filled the model's context window. | Treat the response as truncated. |

##  The stop\_reason field

The `stop_reason` field is part of every successful Messages API response. Unlike errors, which indicate failures in processing your request, `stop_reason` tells you why Claude completed its response generation.

##  Stop reason values

###  end\_turn

The most common stop reason. Indicates Claude finished its response naturally.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
if response.stop_reason == "end_turn":
    # Process the complete response
    print(response.content[0].text)
```

### Empty responses with end\_turn

###  max\_tokens

Claude stopped because it reached the `max_tokens` limit specified in your request.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
# Request with limited tokens
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=10,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum physics"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
    # Response was truncated
    print("Response was cut off at token limit")
    # Consider making another request to continue
```

### Incomplete tool use blocks

###  stop\_sequence

Claude encountered one of your custom stop sequences.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=1024,
    stop_sequences=["END", "STOP"],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Generate text until you say END"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "stop_sequence":
    print(f"Stopped at sequence: {response.stop_sequence}")
```

###  tool\_use

Claude is calling a tool and expects you to execute it.



For most tool use implementations, use the [tool runner](agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-runner.md), which automatically handles tool execution, result formatting, and conversation management.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
weather_tool = {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City and state"},
        },
        "required": ["location"],
    },
}

def execute_tool(name, tool_input):
    """Execute a tool and return the result."""
    return f"Weather in {tool_input.get('location', 'unknown')}: 72°F"

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[weather_tool],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in San Francisco?"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
    # Extract and execute the tool
    for block in response.content:
        if block.type == "tool_use":
            result = execute_tool(block.name, block.input)
            # Return result to Claude for final response
```

A `tool_use` response can also contain a `server_tool_use` block whose `id` has no matching result block. That server tool call is not finished, and this response does not carry its result. In the common case, Claude calls a [server tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools.md) and one of your client tools in the same group of parallel tool calls: the API returns without running the server tool so that you can run the client tools first. There is no other marker for the state; detect it by checking each `server_tool_use` or `mcp_tool_use` block's `id` for a matching result block.



With [programmatic tool calling](agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling.md), the same response shape means something different. The client `tool_use` block comes from code that is running in the `code_execution` tool rather than from Claude directly, and its `caller` field names the `code_execution` block that called it. That code has already started: it is paused waiting for your `tool_result` blocks, and sending them resumes the execution instead of starting a deferred tool. The `code_execution` block's own result block arrives once the code finishes, which can take more than one round of tool results. The follow-up user message itself is the same in both cases; with programmatic tool calling, also pass back the `id` from the response's `container` field, as that page shows.

A mixed tool\_use response



```shiki
{
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "server_tool_use",
      "id": "srvtoolu_01HxbWnMRmbWyMfUtJKC45rA",
      "name": "web_fetch",
      "input": { "url": "https://example.com/article" }
    },
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01PjgRJLbXrXEMZwDNYLnBqk",
      "name": "run_command",
      "input": { "command": "uname -a" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The continuation is a user message of `tool_result` blocks, one for every `tool_use` block in the response (see [Handle tool calls](agents-and-tools/tool-use/handle-tool-calls.md)), with two extra rules: that message must contain nothing except the `tool_result` blocks, and the request must keep the same `tools` array. A resume request that no longer defines the waiting server tool fails with a 400 whose message ends `but no web_fetch tool was provided`. The API attaches your results to the still-open assistant turn, runs the deferred server tool (for paused code execution, resumes it), and continues the turn. For a server tool Claude called directly, the next response's `content` starts with the result block that answers the previous response's `server_tool_use` `id`.

The follow-up user message



```shiki
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01PjgRJLbXrXEMZwDNYLnBqk",
      "content": "Linux demo-host 6.8.0-52-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux"
    }
  ]
}
```

Adding anything after the `tool_result` blocks in that user message, such as text, ends the assistant turn; for a server tool Claude called directly, the request then fails with a 400 `invalid_request_error` that names the unresolved server tool:

```block
`web_fetch` tool use with id `srvtoolu_01HxbWnMRmbWyMfUtJKC45rA` was found without a corresponding `web_fetch_tool_result` block
```



Leaving out a `tool_result`, or putting one after other content, fails earlier with the standard `tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks immediately after` error instead. To give Claude more input, send it as a separate user message after the turn completes.

###  pause\_turn

Returned when the server-side sampling loop reaches its iteration limit while executing [server tools](agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools.md) like web search or web fetch. The default limit is 10 iterations per request.

When this happens, the response may contain a `server_tool_use` block without a corresponding result block. To let Claude finish processing, continue the conversation by sending the response back as-is. A response that leaves a client `tool_use` block waiting on you never has a `stop_reason` of `pause_turn`: when Claude stops to call your tools, `stop_reason` is [`tool_use`](#tool-use), and you continue it by sending the client `tool_result` blocks instead of the response itself.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=4096,
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search"}],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Search for latest AI news"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "pause_turn":
    # Continue the conversation by sending the response back
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Search for latest AI news"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content},
    ]
    continuation = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-8",
        max_tokens=4096,
        messages=messages,
        tools=[{"type": "web_search_20250305", "name": "web_search"}],
    )
```



Your application should handle `pause_turn` in any agent loop that uses server tools. Add the assistant's response to your messages array and make another API request to let Claude continue.

###  refusal

Claude declined to generate a response. On Claude Fable 5, safety classifiers return this stop reason as a normal HTTP 200 response, not an error.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "[Unsafe request]"}],
)

if response.stop_reason == "refusal":
    # Claude declined to respond
    print("Claude was unable to process this request")
    # Consider rephrasing or modifying the request
```



If you encounter `refusal` stop reasons frequently while using Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.1 ([deprecated](about-claude/model-deprecations.md)), you can try updating your API calls to use Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`), which has different usage restrictions. Learn more about [understanding Sonnet 4.5's API safety filters](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12449294-understanding-sonnet-4-5-s-api-safety-filters).

On a refusal, the `stop_details` object identifies the policy category that triggered it. The categories and the full refusal response shape are covered on [Refusals and fallback](build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback.md). `stop_details` is `null` for all stop reasons other than `refusal`.

A refused request on Claude Fable 5 can usually be served by retrying on another Claude model, and [Refusals and fallback](build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback.md) shows how to set up that retry, server-side or in your client. [Fallback credit](build-with-claude/fallback-credit.md) covers how to avoid paying the prompt-cache cost twice when you build the retry yourself.

###  model\_context\_window\_exceeded

Claude stopped because it reached the model's context window limit. This lets you request the maximum possible tokens without knowing the exact input size.



This stop reason is currently typed only in the SDKs' `beta` namespace, so the following examples call `client.beta.messages` and use the `Beta`-prefixed types. On Sonnet 4.5 and newer models the API returns this value without a beta header. For earlier models, add the `model-context-window-exceeded-2025-08-26` beta header to enable it.

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
# Request with maximum tokens to get as much as possible
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=20000,  # Python SDK requires streaming for max_tokens above ~21k (Opus 4.8 supports 128k with streaming)
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Large input that uses most of context window..."}
    ],
)

if response.stop_reason == "model_context_window_exceeded":
    # Response hit context window limit before max_tokens
    print("Response reached model's context window limit")
    # The response is still valid but was limited by context window
```

##  Best practices for handling stop reasons

###  Always check stop\_reason

Make it a habit to check the `stop_reason` in your response handling logic:

PythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
def handle_response(response):
    if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
        return handle_tool_use(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
        return handle_truncation(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "model_context_window_exceeded":
        return handle_context_limit(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "pause_turn":
        return handle_pause(response)
    elif response.stop_reason == "refusal":
        return handle_refusal(response)
    else:
        # Handle end_turn and other cases
        return response.content[0].text
```

###  Handle truncated responses gracefully

When a response is truncated because of token limits or the context window, append a notice so the reader knows the output is incomplete. To continue generating from where the response left off instead, see [Ensuring complete responses](#ensuring-complete-responses).

PythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
def handle_truncated_response(response):
    if response.stop_reason in ["max_tokens", "model_context_window_exceeded"]:
        if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
            note = "[Response truncated due to max_tokens limit]"
        else:
            note = "[Response truncated due to context window limit]"
        return f"{response.content[0].text}\n\n{note}"
    return response.content[0].text
```

###  Implement retry logic for pause\_turn

When using [server tools](agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools.md), the API may return `pause_turn` if the server-side sampling loop reaches its iteration limit (default 10). Handle this by continuing the conversation:

PythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
def handle_server_tool_conversation(client, user_query, tools, max_continuations=5):
    """
    Handle server tool conversations that may require multiple continuations.

    The server runs a sampling loop when executing server tools. If the loop
    reaches its iteration limit, the API returns pause_turn. Continue the
    conversation by sending the response back to let Claude finish.
    """
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_query}]

    for _ in range(max_continuations):
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-8", max_tokens=4096, messages=messages, tools=tools
        )

        if response.stop_reason != "pause_turn":
            # Claude finished processing - return the final response
            return response

        # pause_turn: replace the full message list to maintain alternating roles
        messages = [
            {"role": "user", "content": user_query},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": response.content},
        ]

    # Reached max continuations - return the last response
    return response
```

##  Stop reasons vs. errors

It's important to distinguish between `stop_reason` values and actual errors:

###  Stop reasons (successful responses)

- Part of the response body
- Indicate why generation stopped normally
- Response contains valid content

###  Errors (failed requests)

- HTTP status codes 4xx or 5xx
- Indicate request processing failures
- Response contains error details

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

try:
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-8",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    )

    # Handle successful response with stop_reason
    if response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
        print("Response was truncated")

except anthropic.APIStatusError as e:
    # Handle actual errors
    if e.status_code == 429:
        print("Rate limit exceeded")
    elif e.status_code == 500:
        print("Server error")
```

##  Streaming considerations

When using streaming, `stop_reason` is:

- `null` in the initial `message_start` event
- Provided in the `message_delta` event
- Not provided in any other events

cURLCLIPythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with client.messages.stream(
    model="claude-opus-4-8",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "message_delta":
            stop_reason = event.delta.stop_reason
            if stop_reason:
                print(f"Stream ended with: {stop_reason}")
```

##  Common patterns

###  Handling tool use workflows



**Simpler with tool runner:** The following example shows manual tool handling. For most use cases, the [tool runner](agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-runner.md) automatically handles tool execution with much less code.

PythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
def complete_tool_workflow(client, user_query, tools):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user_query}]

    while True:
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-8", max_tokens=1024, messages=messages, tools=tools
        )

        if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
            # Execute tools and continue
            tool_results = execute_tools(response.content)
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})
            messages.append({"role": "user", "content": tool_results})
        else:
            # Final response
            return response
```

###  Ensuring complete responses

PythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
def get_complete_response(client, prompt, max_attempts=3):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    full_response = ""

    for _ in range(max_attempts):
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-opus-4-8", messages=messages, max_tokens=4096
        )

        full_response += response.content[0].text

        if response.stop_reason != "max_tokens":
            break

        # Continue from where it left off
        messages = [
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": full_response},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Please continue from where you left off."},
        ]

    return full_response
```

###  Getting maximum tokens without knowing input size

With the `model_context_window_exceeded` stop reason, you can request the maximum possible tokens without calculating input size:

PythonTypeScriptC#GoJavaPHPRuby



```shiki
def get_max_possible_tokens(client, prompt):
    """
    Get as many tokens as possible within the model's context window
    without needing to calculate input token count
    """
    response = client.beta.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-8",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        max_tokens=20000,  # Python SDK requires streaming for max_tokens above ~21k
    )

    if response.stop_reason == "model_context_window_exceeded":
        # Got the maximum possible tokens given input size
        print(
            f"Generated {response.usage.output_tokens} tokens (context limit reached)"
        )
    elif response.stop_reason == "max_tokens":
        # Got exactly the requested tokens
        print(f"Generated {response.usage.output_tokens} tokens (max_tokens reached)")
    else:
        # Natural completion
        print(f"Generated {response.usage.output_tokens} tokens (natural completion)")

    return response.content[0].text
```
