# MCP connector

Claude Managed Agents supports connecting [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers to your agents. This gives the agent access to external tools, data sources, and services through a standardized protocol.

MCP configuration is split across two steps:

1. **Agent creation** declares which MCP servers the agent connects to, by name and URL.
2. **Session creation** supplies authentication for those servers by referencing a pre-registered vault (see [Authenticate with vaults](managed-agents/vaults.md)).

This separation keeps secrets out of reusable agent definitions while letting each session authenticate with its own credentials.

## Declare MCP servers on the agent

Specify MCP servers in the `mcp_servers` array when creating an agent. Each server needs a `type`, a unique `name`, and a `url`. No authentication tokens are provided at this stage.

Each declared server also needs a matching `mcp_toolset` entry in the `tools` array. The toolset's `mcp_server_name` must match the server's `name`.

name: GitHub Assistant
model: claude-opus-5
mcp_servers:
  - type: url
    name: github
    url: https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/
tools:
  - type: agent_toolset_20260401
  - type: mcp_toolset
    mcp_server_name: github

```

### `mcp_servers` field reference

Each entry in the `mcp_servers` array defines one connection.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Required. Must be `"url"`. |
| `name` | Required. A unique name for this server within the agent (1–255 characters). Used as the `mcp_server_name` in the `tools` array and surfaced on MCP tool events in the [session event stream](managed-agents/events-and-streaming.md). |
| `url` | Required. The endpoint of the remote MCP server (up to 2,048 characters). See [Supported MCP server types](managed-agents/reference.md) for transport requirements. |

Constraints:

- An agent can declare up to 20 MCP servers. Server names must be unique within the array.
- Every `mcp_servers` entry must be referenced by an `mcp_toolset` in the `tools` array, and every `mcp_toolset` must reference a declared server. The API rejects agent definitions with unreferenced servers or dangling toolsets.

## Configure which MCP tools are available

The `mcp_toolset` entry supports a `default_config` object and a `configs` array, applied to the tools the MCP server exposes. Each `configs` entry accepts only `name`, `enabled`, and `permission_policy`. Unlike entries in the built-in agent toolset, MCP tool entries do not take a `type` field, and the [web settings](managed-agents/tools.md) available on `web_search` and `web_fetch` do not apply to MCP tools. The `name` in each `configs` entry is the bare tool name as reported by the server.

By default all tools exposed by the MCP server are enabled. To enable only specific tools, set `default_config.enabled` to `false` and explicitly enable the tools you want:

```shiki
{
  "type": "mcp_toolset",
  "mcp_server_name": "github",
  "default_config": { "enabled": false },
  "configs": [
    { "name": "get_issue", "enabled": true },
    { "name": "list_issues", "enabled": true },
    { "name": "add_issue_comment", "enabled": true }
  ]
}
```



This pattern is useful when a server exposes many tools but the agent only needs a few, or when you want tools added by the server operator to stay off until you review them.

To disable specific tools while keeping the rest enabled, omit `default_config` and set `enabled: false` on individual entries:

```shiki
{
  "type": "mcp_toolset",
  "mcp_server_name": "github",
  "configs": [{ "name": "delete_repository", "enabled": false }]
}
```

See [configuring the toolset](managed-agents/tools.md) for the general `default_config` / `configs` pattern, and [MCP toolset permissions](managed-agents/permission-policies.md) for setting `permission_policy` on MCP tools and handling confirmation requests.

### MCP tool output handling

When an MCP tool output exceeds 100,000 characters (about 25,000 tokens), it is automatically written to a file in the sandbox. The model receives a truncated preview with the file path and can read the full content from there.

## Provide authentication at session creation

When starting a session, pass `vault_ids` to provide credentials for your MCP servers. Vaults are collections of credentials that you register once and reference by ID. See [Authenticate with vaults](managed-agents/vaults.md) for how to create vaults and manage credentials.



```shiki
session = client.beta.sessions.create(
    agent=agent.id,
    environment_id=environment.id,
    vault_ids=[vault.id],
)
```

Credentials are matched by URL, so the vault must contain a credential whose `mcp_server_url` refers to the same server as the `url` declared in `mcp_servers`. Both URLs are normalized before matching (scheme and host lowercased, default ports and trailing slashes stripped), so differences in host casing, a default port, or a trailing slash don't prevent a match; a different path, subdomain, or non-default port does. If none matches, the connection is attempted unauthenticated. See [Add a credential](managed-agents/vaults.md) for the `static_bearer` and `mcp_oauth` credential types.

### Handle connection and authentication failures

Session creation does not validate MCP connectivity or credentials. If an MCP server is unreachable or rejects the supplied credential, the session still starts and interaction remains possible. A [`session.error`](managed-agents/events-and-streaming.md) event is emitted with the `mcp_server_name` of the affected server and a `retry_status`:

| Error type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `mcp_connection_failed_error` | The MCP server could not be reached (network error, timeout, or non-authentication HTTP failure). |
| `mcp_authentication_failed_error` | Authentication with the MCP server failed: the server rejected the credential from the attached vault, required authentication when no matching credential was configured, or an OAuth token refresh failed. |

You can decide whether to block further interaction on this error, trigger a credential rotation, or let the session continue without the affected server's tools. The connection is retried on the next `session.status_idle` to `session.status_running` transition.
