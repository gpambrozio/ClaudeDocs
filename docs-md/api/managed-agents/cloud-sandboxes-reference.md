# Cloud sandbox reference

Copy page



Cloud sandboxes run as isolated Linux containers on Anthropic-managed infrastructure. They come pre-installed with a comprehensive set of programming languages, databases, and utilities. The agent can use these immediately without any installation steps.

These specifications apply to `cloud` environments. Self-hosted sandboxes run on your infrastructure with whatever your worker provides.



All Managed Agents API requests require the `managed-agents-2026-04-01` beta header. The SDK sets the beta header automatically.
