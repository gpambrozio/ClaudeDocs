class BetaSelfHostedWork:

Work resource representing a unit of work in a self-hosted environment.

Work items are queued when sessions are created or when long-dormant sessions
receive new messages. The environment worker polls for work to execute in a
self-hosted sandbox.

required string ID

Work identifier (e.g., 'work\_...')

required string? AcknowledgedAt

RFC 3339 timestamp when the work item was acknowledged and assigned to a self-hosted sandbox

required string CreatedAt

RFC 3339 timestamp when work was created

required [BetaSessionWorkData](api/beta.md) Data

The actual work to be performed

required string ID

Session identifier (e.g., 'session\_...')

JsonElement Type "session"constant

Type of work data

required string EnvironmentID

Environment identifier this work belongs to (e.g., `env_...`)

Response when listing work items with cursor-based pagination.

required IReadOnlyList<[BetaSelfHostedWork](api/beta.md)> Data

List of work items

required string ID

Work identifier (e.g., 'work\_...')

required string? AcknowledgedAt

RFC 3339 timestamp when the work item was acknowledged and assigned to a self-hosted sandbox

class BetaSelfHostedWorkQueueStats:

Statistics about the work queue for an environment.

Uses Redis Stream consumer group metrics for O(1) queries.

required Long Depth
