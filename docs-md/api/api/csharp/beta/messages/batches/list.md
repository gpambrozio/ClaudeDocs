class BatchListPageResponse:

required IReadOnlyList<[BetaMessageBatch](api/beta.md)> Data

required string ID

Unique object identifier.

The format and length of IDs may change over time.

required DateTimeOffset? ArchivedAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was archived and its results became unavailable.

required DateTimeOffset? CancelInitiatedAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which cancellation was initiated for the Message Batch. Specified only if cancellation was initiated.

required DateTimeOffset CreatedAt

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

required DateTimeOffset? EndedAt

"canceling"Canceling

"ended"Ended

required [BetaMessageBatchRequestCounts](api/beta.md) RequestCounts

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

JsonElement Type "message\_batch"constant

Object type.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.

required string? FirstID

First ID in the `data` list. Can be used as the `before_id` for the previous page.
