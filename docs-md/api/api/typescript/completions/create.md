# Create a Text Completion

[Legacy] Create a Text Completion.

The Text Completions API is a legacy API. We recommend using the [Messages API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages) going forward.

Future models and features will not be compatible with Text Completions. See our [migration guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/migrating-from-text-completions-to-messages) for guidance in migrating from Text Completions to Messages.

##### ParametersExpand Collapse



max\_tokens\_to\_sample: number

Body param: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

Note that our models may stop *before* reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.



model: [Model](api/messages.md)

Body param: The model that will complete your prompt.

(string & {})



prompt: string

Body param: The prompt that you want Claude to complete.

For proper response generation you will need to format your prompt using alternating `

Human:`and`

Assistant:` conversational turns. For example:

```
"

Human: {userQuestion}

Assistant:"
```

See [prompt validation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/prompt-validation) and our guide to [prompt design](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/intro-to-prompting) for more details.

minLength1



metadata?: [Metadata](api/messages.md) { user\_id } 

Body param: An object describing metadata about the request.



user\_id?: string | null

An external identifier for the user who is associated with the request.

This should be a uuid, hash value, or other opaque identifier. Anthropic may use this id to help detect abuse. Do not include any identifying information such as name, email address, or phone number.

maxLength512



stop\_sequences?: Array<string>

Body param: Sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

Our models stop on `"

Human:"`, and may include additional built-in stop sequences in the future. By providing the stop\_sequences parameter, you may include additional strings that will cause the model to stop generating.



stream?: false

Body param: Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

See [streaming](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/streaming) for details.



Deprecatedtemperature?: number

Body param: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not support setting temperature. A value of 1.0 of will be accepted for backwards compatibility, all other values will be rejected with a 400 error.

Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

maximum1

minimum0



Deprecatedtop\_k?: number

Body param: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not accept top\_k; any value will be rejected with a 400 error.

Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

Recommended for advanced use cases only.

minimum0



Deprecatedtop\_p?: number

Body param: Use nucleus sampling.

Deprecated. Models released after Claude Opus 4.6 do not support setting top\_p. A value >= 0.99 will be accepted for backwards compatibility, all other values will be rejected with a 400 error.

In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`.

Recommended for advanced use cases only.

betas?: Array<[AnthropicBeta](api/beta.md)>

Header param: Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.
