# Retrieve a Message Batch

client.messages.batches.retrieve(stringmessageBatchID, RequestOptionsoptions?): [MessageBatch](api/messages.md) { id, archived\_at, cancel\_initiated\_at, 7 more }

get/v1/messages/batches/{message\_batch\_id}

This endpoint is idempotent and can be used to poll for Message Batch completion. To access the results of a Message Batch, make a request to the `results_url` field in the response.

"in\_progress"

"canceling"

"ended"

request\_counts: [MessageBatchRequestCounts](api/messages.md) { canceled, errored, expired, 2 more }

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.
