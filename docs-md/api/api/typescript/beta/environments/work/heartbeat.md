# Record Heartbeat

client.beta.environments.work.heartbeat(stringworkID, WorkHeartbeatParams { environment\_id, desired\_ttl\_seconds, expected\_last\_heartbeat, betas } params, RequestOptionsoptions?): [BetaSelfHostedWorkHeartbeatResponse](api/beta.md) { last\_heartbeat, lease\_extended, state, 2 more }

POST/v1/environments/{environment\_id}/work/{work\_id}/heartbeat

Note: these endpoints are called automatically by the pre-built environment worker provided in the SDKs and CLI, for orchestrating sessions with self-hosted sandbox environments. They are included here as a reference; you do not need to invoke them directly.

Record a heartbeat for a work item to maintain the lease.

##### ParametersExpand Collapse

workID: string

params: WorkHeartbeatParams { environment\_id, desired\_ttl\_seconds, expected\_last\_heartbeat, betas }

environment\_id: string

Path param

desired\_ttl\_seconds?: number | null

Query param: Desired TTL in seconds

expected\_last\_heartbeat?: string | null

Query param: Expected last\_heartbeat for conditional update (optimistic concurrency). Use literal 'NO\_HEARTBEAT' to claim an unclaimed lease (first heartbeat). For subsequent heartbeats, echo the server's previous last\_heartbeat value exactly. Returns 412 Precondition Failed if the actual value doesn't match.

betas?: Array<[AnthropicBeta](api/beta.md)>

Header param: Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.
