# Poll for Work

client.beta.environments.work.poll(stringenvironmentID, WorkPollParams { block\_ms, reclaim\_older\_than\_ms, betas, Anthropic-Worker-ID } params?, RequestOptionsoptions?): [BetaSelfHostedWork](api/beta/environments/work.md) { id, acknowledged\_at, created\_at, 9 more }  | null

GET/v1/environments/{environment\_id}/work/poll

Note: these endpoints are called automatically by the pre-built environment worker provided in the SDKs and CLI, for orchestrating sessions with self-hosted sandbox environments. They are included here as a reference; you do not need to invoke them directly.

Long poll for work items in the queue.
