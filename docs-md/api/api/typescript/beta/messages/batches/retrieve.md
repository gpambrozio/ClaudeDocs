GET/v1/messages/batches/{message\_batch\_id}

created\_at: string

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.



ended\_at: string | null

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which processing for the Message Batch ended. Specified only once processing ends.
