# Archive Tunnel

POST/v1/tunnels/{tunnel\_id}/archive

The Tunnels API is in research preview. It requires the `anthropic-beta: mcp-tunnels-2026-06-22` header and may change without a deprecation period. It supersedes the Admin API endpoints at `/v1/organizations/tunnels`, which remain available during a migration window.

Archives a tunnel. Archival is irreversible: every non-archived certificate on the tunnel is archived in the same operation, the hostname is retired and never re-allocated, and the tunnel token is invalidated. Retrying against an already-archived tunnel returns the existing record unchanged.
