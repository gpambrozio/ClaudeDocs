# Cancel a Message Batch

client.Messages.Batches.Cancel(ctx, messageBatchID) (\*[MessageBatch](api/messages/batches.md), error)

POST/v1/messages/batches/{message\_batch\_id}/cancel

Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](build-with-claude/batch-processing.md)
