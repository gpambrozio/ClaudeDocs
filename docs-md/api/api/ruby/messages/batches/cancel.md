# Cancel a Message Batch

messages.batches.cancel(message\_batch\_id) -> [MessageBatch](api/messages.md) { id, archived\_at, cancel\_initiated\_at, 7 more }

post/v1/messages/batches/{message\_batch\_id}/cancel

Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

##### ParametersExpand Collapse

message\_batch\_id: String

ID of the Message Batch.

##### ReturnsExpand Collapse

class MessageBatch { id, archived\_at, cancel\_initiated\_at, 7 more }

id: String

Unique object identifier.

The format and length of IDs may change over time.

archived\_at: Time

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was archived and its results became unavailable.

formatdate-time

cancel\_initiated\_at: Time

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which cancellation was initiated for the Message Batch. Specified only if cancellation was initiated.

formatdate-time

created\_at: Time

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

formatdate-time

ended\_at: Time

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which processing for the Message Batch ended. Specified only once processing ends.

Processing ends when every request in a Message Batch has either succeeded, errored, canceled, or expired.

formatdate-time

expires\_at: Time

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch will expire and end processing, which is 24 hours after creation.

formatdate-time

processing\_status: :in\_progress | :canceling | :ended

Processing status of the Message Batch.

Accepts one of the following:

:in\_progress

:canceling

:ended

request\_counts: [MessageBatchRequestCounts](api/messages.md) { canceled, errored, expired, 2 more }

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

canceled: Integer

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have been canceled.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

errored: Integer

Number of requests in the Message Batch that encountered an error.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

expired: Integer

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have expired.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

processing: Integer

Number of requests in the Message Batch that are processing.

succeeded: Integer

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

results\_url: String

URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

type: :message\_batch

Object type.

For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.

Accepts one of the following:

:message\_batch
