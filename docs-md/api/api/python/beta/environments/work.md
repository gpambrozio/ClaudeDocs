class BetaSelfHostedWork: …

Work resource representing a unit of work in a self-hosted environment.

Work items are queued when sessions are created or when long-dormant sessions
receive new messages. The environment worker polls for work to execute in a
self-hosted sandbox.

id: str

Work identifier (e.g., 'work\_...')

acknowledged\_at: Optional[str]

RFC 3339 timestamp when the work item was acknowledged and assigned to a self-hosted sandbox

created\_at: str

RFC 3339 timestamp when work was created

data: [BetaSessionWorkData](api/beta.md)

The actual work to be performed

id: str

Session identifier (e.g., 'session\_...')

type: Literal["session"]

Type of work data

environment\_id: str

Environment identifier this work belongs to (e.g., `env_...`)

latest\_heartbeat\_at: Optional[str]

RFC 3339 timestamp of the most recent heartbeat

metadata: Dict[str, str]

state: Literal["queued", "starting", "active", 2 more]

Current state of the work item

Accepts one of the following:

"queued"

"starting"

"active"

"stopping"

"stopped"

stop\_requested\_at: Optional[str]

RFC 3339 timestamp when stop was requested

class BetaSelfHostedWorkHeartbeatResponse: …

Response after recording a heartbeat for a work item.

last\_heartbeat: str

RFC 3339 timestamp of the actual heartbeat from DB

lease\_extended: bool

state: Literal["queued", "starting", "active", 2 more]

Current state of the work item (active/stopping/stopped)

Accepts one of the following:

"queued"

"starting"

"active"

"stopping"

"stopped"

ttl\_seconds: int

Effective TTL applied to the lease

type: Literal["work\_heartbeat"]

The type of response

class BetaSelfHostedWorkListResponse: …

Response when listing work items with cursor-based pagination.

data: List[[BetaSelfHostedWork](api/beta.md)]

List of work items

id: str

Work identifier (e.g., 'work\_...')

acknowledged\_at: Optional[str]

RFC 3339 timestamp when the work item was acknowledged and assigned to a self-hosted sandbox

created\_at: str

RFC 3339 timestamp when work was created

data: [BetaSessionWorkData](api/beta.md)
