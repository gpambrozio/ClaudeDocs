# Acknowledge Work

beta.environments.work.ack(strwork\_id, WorkAckParams\*\*kwargs)  -> [BetaSelfHostedWork](api/beta/environments/work.md)

POST/v1/environments/{environment\_id}/work/{work\_id}/ack

Note: these endpoints are called automatically by the pre-built environment worker provided in the SDKs and CLI, for orchestrating sessions with self-hosted sandbox environments. They are included here as a reference; you do not need to invoke them directly.

Acknowledge receipt of a work item, transitioning it from 'queued' to 'starting' and removing it from the queue.
