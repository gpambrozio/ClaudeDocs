# Retrieve a Message Batch

messages.batches.retrieve(strmessage\_batch\_id)  -> [MessageBatch](api/messages.md)

get/v1/messages/batches/{message\_batch\_id}

This endpoint is idempotent and can be used to poll for Message Batch completion. To access the results of a Message Batch, make a request to the `results_url` field in the response.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

formatdate-time

ended\_at: Optional[datetime]

Processing status of the Message Batch.

Accepts one of the following:

"in\_progress"

"canceling"

"ended"

request\_counts: [MessageBatchRequestCounts](api/messages.md)

Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

succeeded: int

Number of requests in the Message Batch that have completed successfully.

This is zero until processing of the entire Message Batch has ended.

results\_url: Optional[str]

URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.
