

[ManagedAgentsMemoryVersion](api/beta.md)

string id

Unique identifier for this version (a `memver_...` value).

\Datetime createdAt

A timestamp in RFC 3339 format

string memoryID

ID of the memory this version snapshots (a `mem_...` value). Remains valid after the memory is deleted; pass it as `memory_id` to [List memory versions](api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/list.md) to retrieve the full lineage including the `deleted` row.

string memoryStoreID

ID of the memory store this version belongs to (a `memstore_...` value).

[ManagedAgentsMemoryVersionOperation](api/beta.md) operation

The kind of mutation a `memory_version` records. Every non-no-op mutation to a memory appends exactly one version row with one of these values.

Type type

?string content

The memory's UTF-8 text content as of this version. `null` when `view=basic`, when `operation` is `deleted`, or when `redacted_at` is set.

?string contentSha256

Lowercase hex SHA-256 digest of `content` as of this version (64 characters). `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

?int contentSizeBytes

Size of `content` in bytes as of this version. `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

?[ManagedAgentsActor](api/beta.md) createdBy

Identifies who performed a write or redact operation. Captured at write time on the `memory_version` row. The API key that created a session is not recorded on agent writes; attribution answers who made the write, not who is ultimately responsible. Look up session provenance separately via the [Sessions API](api/sessions-retrieve.md).

?string path

The memory's path at the time of this write. `null` if and only if `redacted_at` is set.

?\Datetime redactedAt

A timestamp in RFC 3339 format

?[ManagedAgentsActor](api/beta.md) redactedBy

Identifies who performed a write or redact operation. Captured at write time on the `memory_version` row. The API key that created a session is not recorded on agent writes; attribution answers who made the write, not who is ultimately responsible. Look up session provenance separately via the [Sessions API](api/sessions-retrieve.md).
