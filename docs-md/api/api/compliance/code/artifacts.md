

ArtifactListResponse object { id, organization\_uuid, owner\_user\_id, 5 more } 

A hosted site published via Claude Code.

id: string

Artifact identifier (tagged ID)

organization\_uuid: string

Organization UUID this Artifact belongs to

owner\_user\_id: string or null

Artifact owner's user identifier (tagged ID), or null for Artifacts published by an agent session rather than a user account. When set, it survives after the owner's account is deleted or the owner leaves every organization under the parent.

published\_version\_id: string or null

Identifier of the version a non-owner viewer would render when `read_mode` permits them — the version the owner has pinned for non-owner readers if one is pinned, otherwise the owner's latest. When `read_mode` is `owner` no non-owner renders any version; the field still reports which version would be served were read\_mode widened.



read\_mode: "org" or "owner" or "public" or "users"

Who can view this Artifact: only its owner, a named set of users, every member of its organization, or anyone on the internet (`public`)

One of the following:

"org"

"owner"

"public"

"users"

updated\_at: string or null

Artifact last update timestamp, or null for Artifacts published before this field was recorded



user: object { id, email\_address }  or null

The user who owns a Code Artifact.

Fields that reference this type are null when the Artifact was
published by an agent session rather than a user account, when the
owner's account has been deleted, or when the owner is no longer a
member of an organization the key may read.

id: string

User identifier (tagged ID)

email\_address: string

User's email address



versions: array of object { id, created\_at, name } 

Up to roughly 20 most-recently-published versions of this Artifact (older versions are not retained). Metadata only — use `GET /v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/{artifact_id}/versions/{version_id}` to download a version's content.

id: string

Opaque version identifier

created\_at: string or null

When this version was published

name: string

Artifact title at this version. Falls back to the version identifier when the title for an older version is no longer retained.



ArtifactDeleteResponse object { id, type } 

Response for deleting a Code Artifact.

id: string

The ID of the Artifact that was deleted

type: "code\_artifact\_deleted"
