Identifies who performed a write or redact operation. Captured at write time on the `memory_version` row. The API key that created a session is not recorded on agent writes; attribution answers who made the write, not who is ultimately responsible. Look up session provenance separately via the [Sessions API](api/sessions-retrieve.md).



beta\_managed\_agents\_session\_actor: object { session\_id, type } 

Attribution for a write made by an agent during a session, through the mounted filesystem at `/mnt/memory/`.

session\_id: string

ID of the session that performed the write (a `sesn_...` value). Look up the session via [Retrieve a session](api/sessions-retrieve.md) for further provenance.

Attribution for a write made directly via the public API (outside of any session).

beta\_managed\_agents\_memory\_version: object { id, created\_at, memory\_id, 10 more } 

A `memory_version` object: one immutable, attributed row in a memory's append-only history. Every non-no-op mutation to a memory produces a new version. Versions belong to the store (not the individual memory) and persist after the memory is deleted. Retrieving a redacted version returns 200 with `content`, `path`, `content_size_bytes`, and `content_sha256` set to `null`; branch on `redacted_at`, not HTTP status.

id: string

Unique identifier for this version (a `memver_...` value).

created\_at: string

A timestamp in RFC 3339 format

memory\_id: string

ID of the memory this version snapshots (a `mem_...` value). Remains valid after the memory is deleted; pass it as `memory_id` to [List memory versions](api/beta/memory_stores/memory_versions/list.md) to retrieve the full lineage including the `deleted` row.

memory\_store\_id: string

ID of the memory store this version belongs to (a `memstore_...` value).



operation: "created" or "modified" or "deleted"

The kind of mutation a `memory_version` records. Every non-no-op mutation to a memory appends exactly one version row with one of these values.

"memory\_version"

content: optional string

The memory's UTF-8 text content as of this version. `null` when `view=basic`, when `operation` is `deleted`, or when `redacted_at` is set.

content\_sha256: optional string

Lowercase hex SHA-256 digest of `content` as of this version (64 characters). `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.

content\_size\_bytes: optional number

Size of `content` in bytes as of this version. `null` when `redacted_at` is set or `operation` is `deleted`. Populated regardless of `view` otherwise.
