# Get Token Usage Over Time

GET/v1/organizations/analytics/usage\_report

Get token usage over time across a date range.

Returns token usage bucketed by minute, hour, or day, optionally broken
down by product, model, context window, inference region, or speed.
Available to organizations on a Claude Enterprise plan. Requires an API
key with the `read:analytics` scope.

##### Query ParametersExpand Collapse

starting\_at: string

Start of range, inclusive. RFC 3339 tz-aware. Must be within the last 365 days and no earlier than 2026-01-01T00:00

.



bucket\_width: optional "1d" or "1h" or "1m"

Time bucket granularity.

One of the following:

"1d"

"1h"

"1m"



context\_windows: optional array of "0-200k" or "200k-1M"

Filter to specific context-window pricing tiers. Use `group_by[]=context_window` to break out per-tier values.

One of the following:

"0-200k"

"200k-1M"

ending\_at: optional string

End of range, exclusive. When omitted, defaults to the earlier of now and `starting_at` + 31 days. The range may span at most 31 days.



group\_by: optional array of "context\_window" or "inference\_geo" or "model" or 4 more

Dimensions to break each time bucket out by. Defaults to no grouping (one total per bucket). Each bucket reports at most its top 100 groups; a group beyond that cap has no row in that bucket (there is no remainder row), so grouped buckets are not exhaustive when a dimension has more than 100 distinct values.

One of the following:

"context\_window"

"inference\_geo"

"model"

"product"

"rbac\_group\_id"

"slack\_channel\_id"

"speed"



inference\_geos: optional array of "global" or "not\_available" or "us"

Filter to specific inference regions. `not_available` matches rows where the region is unset. Use `group_by[]=inference_geo` to break out per-region values.

One of the following:

"global"

"not\_available"

"us"

limit: optional number

Maximum number of time buckets per page. Defaults and caps vary by bucket\_width (1d: default 7, max 31; 1h: default 24, max 168; 1m: default 60, max 256).

models: optional array of string

Models to include. Defaults to all models. Use `group_by[]=model` to break out per-model values.

page: optional string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page` field.

products: optional array of string

Product surfaces to include. Defaults to all products. Use `group_by[]=product` to break out per-product values. Values include "chat", "claude\_code", "cowork", "office\_agent", "claude\_in\_chrome", "claude\_design", and "claude-in-slack". "claude-in-slack" (with hyphens) is Claude Tag, the Claude product in Slack. A similarly spelled legacy value (underscores instead of hyphens) identifies the retiring v1 Slack chat bot and appears only for organizations that used it.

rbac\_group\_ids: optional array of string

Filter to usage attributed to specific RBAC groups. Accepts tagged RBAC group IDs (`rbac_group_...`) or bare group UUIDs. A row matches when the user belonged to any of the listed groups on the (UTC) day the usage occurred; usage with no group attribution never matches.

slack\_channel\_ids: optional array of string

Filter to usage originating from specific Slack channels. Use `group_by[]=slack_channel_id` to break out per-channel values.



speeds: optional array of "fast" or "standard"

Filter to fast or standard inference mode. Use `group_by[]=speed` to break out per-mode values.

One of the following:

"fast"

"standard"

user\_ids: optional array of string

Filter to specific users by tagged user ID.



UsageBucket object { data, data\_refreshed\_at, has\_more, 2 more } 



cache\_creation: object { ephemeral\_1h\_input\_tokens, ephemeral\_5m\_input\_tokens } 

ephemeral\_1h\_input\_tokens: number

The number of input tokens used to create the 1 hour cache entry.

ephemeral\_5m\_input\_tokens: number

The number of input tokens used to create the 5 minute cache entry.

cache\_read\_input\_tokens: number

The number of input tokens read from the cache.



context\_window: "0-200k" or "200k-1M"

One of the following:

"0-200k"

"200k-1M"



inference\_geo: "global" or "us"

One of the following:

"global"

"us"

model: string

output\_tokens: number

The number of output tokens generated.

product: string

Product surface that produced the usage or cost. Null unless product is in group\_by[]; it can also be null on grouped rows whose usage cannot be attributed to a known surface. Values include "chat", "claude\_code", "cowork", "office\_agent", "claude\_in\_chrome", "claude\_design", and "claude-in-slack". "claude-in-slack" (with hyphens) is Claude Tag, the Claude product in Slack. A similarly spelled legacy value (underscores instead of hyphens) identifies the retiring v1 Slack chat bot and appears only for organizations that used it. Some unattributed usage is reported as "other".

rbac\_group\_id: string

RBAC group (team) the usage is attributed to, in the public tagged `rbac_group_...` spelling — the same spelling the activity resources use for this key, so the same team has ONE id across resources and it round-trips as an `rbac_group_ids[]` filter value. Populated only when `rbac_group_id` is in `group_by[]`. Any-membership semantics: a user in several groups contributes their full usage to each of those groups' rows, so the named-group rows overlap and their sum can exceed the org total. A null value is the single unassigned row: users in no group on that (UTC) day. For the true org total, run the same query with no group\_by.

requests: number

Number of API requests in this row's scope. For sandbox / code-execution events, this counts execution spans rather than HTTP requests (these rows surface with `product: null`).



server\_tool\_use: object { web\_search\_requests } 

web\_search\_requests: number

The number of web search requests made.

slack\_channel\_id: string

Slack channel the usage originated from. Populated only when `slack_channel_id` is in `group_by[]`; null for usage outside Slack (and for rows recorded before channel attribution was enabled).



speed: "fast" or "standard"

One of the following:

"fast"

"standard"

uncached\_input\_tokens: number

The number of uncached input tokens processed.

starting\_at: string

data\_refreshed\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the export this response was served from. Buckets beyond this watermark are incomplete; for stable results, set `ending_at` to this value or earlier. Data is typically refreshed every 4 hours but not final until about 30 days after the usage date (late-arriving events, reconciliation adjustments).

has\_more: boolean

next\_page: string

organization\_id: string

ID of the Organization.
