# Get Plugin Usage

GET/v1/organizations/analytics/plugins

Get per-plugin install + invocation usage for a given day, with pagination.

Returns plugin usage metrics for the organization across Cowork and Claude
Code, sorted by plugin name. The `plugin_name` value `third-party` is
an aggregate bucket, not a plugin: it collects plugin activity, from
either surface, for which the reporting client did not provide a plugin
name — so an organization's own plugins can contribute both to their own
named rows and to this bucket. Requires an API key with the
`read:analytics` scope. `starting_date` / `ending_date` select
range-rollup mode like /skills.

##### Query ParametersExpand Collapse

date: optional string

UTC date in YYYY-MM-DD format. The day to get plugin usage for. Data is typically available with a 1-day lag (varies by query; the error for a too-recent date names the latest available day) and may be revised by a few percent over the following days. No earlier than 2026-01-01.

ending\_date: optional string

UTC date in YYYY-MM-DD format. End of the date range (exclusive); only valid with starting\_date. Data is typically available with a 1-day lag (varies by query; the error for a too-recent date names the latest available day), so this can be at most today — which is also the default when omitted, resolved once when the first page is served and reused for the rest of the pagination sequence. At most 366 days after starting\_date.

filter: optional array of string

Filters as 'dimension

', e.g. filter[]=rbac\_group\_id:<id>. Repeat the param for OR within a dimension and across dimensions for AND. Unsupported dimensions return 400. rbac\_group\_id accepts the tagged id (rbac\_group\_..., as emitted in responses and by the spend-limits API) or a bare group UUID, and matches users who held the group at any point during each covered UTC day (time-of-usage attribution). At most 100 entries.

group\_by: optional array of string

Dimensions to break results out by, e.g. group\_by[]=rbac\_group\_id. Supported dimensions vary by endpoint; an unsupported dimension returns 400. Grouped responses paginate like ungrouped ones via next\_page. rbac\_group\_id attributes a user to every group they held at any point during each covered UTC day, so grouped rows are not an exclusive partition and can sum above org-level totals. At most 100 entries.

limit: optional number

Number of results per page (1-1000, default 100).



order: optional "asc" or "desc"

Sort direction: 'asc' or 'desc'. Defaults to 'asc' for the endpoint's sort column and to 'desc' when order\_by names a metric (a top-N ranking). Applies to order\_by, or to the endpoint's default sort field when order\_by is omitted.

One of the following:

"asc"

"desc"

order\_by: optional string

Sort field. Restricted to the endpoint's sort column, plus — in date-range mode (starting\_date/ending\_date) — the endpoint's rankable metrics (metrics default to descending).

page: optional string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's next\_page field.

starting\_date: optional string

UTC date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Start of a date range (inclusive). Enables rollup mode: one row per entity aggregated over the whole range — addable counters are summed across days, and a distinct count is never summed where summing could double-count (a field's range value is recomputed exactly over the window, approximate via HLL with typical error under 2%, null, or — for the creation-event counts, whose per-day values cannot overlap — a per-day sum that is itself exact; each field's own description says which). Use either date or starting\_date, not both. Data is typically available with a 1-day lag (varies by query; the error for a too-recent date names the latest available day) and may be revised by a few percent over the following days. No earlier than 2026-01-01.



PluginUsage object { data, next\_page } 

Response for GET /v1/organizations/analytics/plugins.



data: array of object { claude\_code\_metrics, cowork\_metrics, distinct\_user\_count, 8 more } 



claude\_code\_metrics: object { distinct\_session\_plugin\_used\_count } 

Claude Code activity metrics for a single plugin on a given day.

distinct\_session\_plugin\_used\_count: number

Number of distinct Claude Code sessions in which the plugin was invoked. Null on aggregated rows where a distinct count cannot be computed.



cowork\_metrics: object { distinct\_session\_plugin\_used\_count } 

Cowork activity metrics for a single plugin on a given day.

distinct\_session\_plugin\_used\_count: number

Number of distinct Cowork sessions in which the plugin was invoked. Null on aggregated rows where a distinct count cannot be computed.

distinct\_user\_count: number

Number of distinct users with recorded install or invocation activity for the plugin on the requested day (install-only users count), or, in date-range mode, over the requested window — recomputed as an exact distinct count over the window's per-member daily rows, never a sum of per-day values.

install\_count: number

Number of distinct users who installed the plugin on the requested day, or, in date-range mode, over the requested window — recomputed as an exact distinct count over the window's per-member daily rows, never a sum of per-day values.

invocation\_count: number

Number of plugin invocations on the requested day

plugin\_name: string

Name of the plugin

plugin\_id: optional string

Stable plugin identifier when available (e.g. serena@claude-plugins-official). Null for third-party Claude Code plugins (redacted at the source) and Cowork slash commands that carry only a hashed id.

product: optional string

Product that produced this row's activity: one of chat, claude\_code, cowork, or office\_agent (the canonical Cost & Usage product naming; an office\_agent row's per-surface breakdown is in its office\_metrics). On /plugins only cowork and claude\_code occur (the only surfaces with plugin attribution); /artifacts and /apps/chat/projects do not support the product dimension (a product group\_by[] or filter[] there is rejected). Present only when the request grouped by product.

rbac\_group\_id: optional string

Tagged RBAC group identifier (rbac\_group\_...), matching the spend-limits API spelling. Present only when the request grouped by rbac\_group\_id.

rbac\_group\_name: optional string

Resolved RBAC group display name, alongside rbac\_group\_id when name resolution is available. Null if the group has been deleted or its name could not be resolved; rbac\_group\_id remains the stable key.

user\_id: optional string

Tagged user identifier (e.g. user\_...). Present only when the request grouped by user\_id.

next\_page: string

Opaque cursor for the next page, or null if no more results
