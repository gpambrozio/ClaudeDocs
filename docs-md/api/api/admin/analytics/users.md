chat\_metrics: object { connectors\_used\_count, distinct\_artifacts\_created\_count, distinct\_connectors\_used\_count, 9 more } 

Claude.ai activity metrics for a single user on a given day.

connectors\_used\_count: number

Number of MCP connector invocations.

distinct\_artifacts\_created\_count: number

distinct\_connectors\_used\_count: number

Distinct claude.ai connectors this user used. Excludes calls whose connector could not be identified and all calls from organizations with zero data retention. Approximate (HLL, typical error <2%) in date-range mode. Null on aggregated rows where a distinct count cannot be computed.
