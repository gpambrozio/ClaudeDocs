# Get Per-User Cost

GET/v1/organizations/analytics/user\_cost\_report

Get per-user cost in USD across a date range.

Returns one row per user, ranked by spend. Use this to see which users
account for the most cost. Only cost attributable to a seat user is
included; for organization-wide totals including direct API-key and
automation traffic, use the bucketed
`/v1/organizations/analytics/cost_report` endpoint. Available to
organizations on a Claude Enterprise plan. Requires an API key with the
`read:analytics` scope.

##### Query ParametersExpand Collapse

starting\_at: string

Start of range, inclusive. RFC 3339 tz-aware. Must be within the last 365 days and no earlier than 2026-01-01T00:00

.



bucket\_width: optional "1d" or "1h" or "1m"

Time-bucket granularity. When set, each row's `starting_at` and `ending_at` are populated and one actor may span several rows (one per time bucket with usage). The time bucket counts toward `limit`, so one page can return multiple rows for the same actor. `ending_at` is required when `bucket_width` is set, and with `bucket_width="1m"` the range may span at most 24 hours. When omitted, each row aggregates the full `[starting_at, ending_at)` range.

One of the following:

"1d"

"1h"

"1m"



context\_windows: optional array of "0-200k" or "200k-1M"

Filter to specific context-window pricing tiers. Use `group_by[]=context_window` to break out per-tier values.

One of the following:

"0-200k"

"200k-1M"

ending\_at: optional string

End of range, exclusive. When omitted, defaults to the earlier of now and `starting_at` + 31 days. The range may span at most 31 days.

exclude\_deleted\_users: optional boolean

If true, omit rows for deleted accounts. Pages may return fewer than `limit` rows when deleted users were filtered.



group\_by: optional array of "context\_window" or "cost\_type" or "inference\_geo" or 5 more

Break each actor's row out by the given dimensions. Accepts the same values as the bucketed `/cost_report` endpoint. The `product`, `model`, `context_window`, `inference_geo`, and `speed` dimensions — and the time bucket, when `bucket_width` is set — count toward `limit`. `cost_type` and `token_type` do not: `cost_type` returns one row per cost component (tokens, web search, code execution); `token_type` returns one row per token type, each with `cost_type: "tokens"`; combining both returns the per-token-type rows plus the web-search and code-execution rows. A page can therefore contain more rows than `limit` when `cost_type` or `token_type` is requested.

One of the following:

"context\_window"

"cost\_type"

"inference\_geo"

"model"

"product"

"rbac\_group\_id"

"speed"

"token\_type"



inference\_geos: optional array of "global" or "not\_available" or "us"

Filter to specific inference regions. `not_available` matches rows where the region is unset. Use `group_by[]=inference_geo` to break out per-region values.

One of the following:

"global"

"not\_available"

"us"

limit: optional number

Number of rows per page (1-1000, default 20). One row per actor unless `group_by[]` or `bucket_width` splits an actor across rows; `cost_type`/`token_type` fan-out rows (cost endpoint only) are the exception — they do not count toward this limit, so `data` can exceed it.

models: optional array of string

Models to include. Defaults to all models. Use `group_by[]=model` to break out per-model values.



order: optional "asc" or "desc"

Sort direction. Defaults to `desc`.

One of the following:

"asc"

"desc"



order\_by: optional "amount" or "list\_amount"

Metric to rank actors by. Defaults to `amount`.

One of the following:

"amount"

"list\_amount"

page: optional string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page` field.

products: optional array of string

Product surfaces to include. Defaults to all products. Values include "chat", "claude\_code", "cowork", "office\_agent", "claude\_in\_chrome", and "claude\_design".

rbac\_group\_ids: optional array of string

Filter to usage attributed to specific RBAC groups. Accepts tagged RBAC group IDs (`rbac_group_...`) or bare group UUIDs. A row matches when the user belonged to any of the listed groups on the (UTC) day the usage occurred; usage with no group attribution never matches.



speeds: optional array of "fast" or "standard"

Filter to fast or standard inference mode. Use `group_by[]=speed` to break out per-mode values.

One of the following:

"fast"

"standard"

user\_ids: optional array of string

Filter to specific users by tagged user ID.

##### ReturnsExpand Collapse



UserCost object { data, data\_refreshed\_at, has\_more, 2 more } 



data: array of object { actor, amount, context\_window, 12 more } 



actor: [AnalyticsUserActor](api/admin/analytics.md) { user\_id, deleted, email, 2 more } 

user\_id: string

Tagged user ID.

deleted: optional boolean

True if the account has been deleted. `name` is `"Deleted User"` and `email` is null in that case; the `user_id` is still populated for reconciliation.

email: optional string

The user's email address. Null when unavailable or when the account has been deleted (check `deleted`).

name: optional string

The user's name. Returns `"Deleted User"` when the account has been deleted (`deleted: true`). Null when unavailable.

type: optional "user\_actor"

amount: string

Amount (post-discount, pre-credit) in fractional cents (minor units).



context\_window: "0-200k" or "200k-1M"

One of the following:

"0-200k"

"200k-1M"



cost\_type: "code\_execution" or "tokens" or "web\_search"

Cost component breakdown; null when returning the combined total.

One of the following:

"code\_execution"

"tokens"

"web\_search"

currency: "USD"

ending\_at: string



inference\_geo: "global" or "us"

One of the following:

"global"

"us"

list\_amount: string

List-price amount (pre-discount) in fractional cents.

model: string

product: string

Product surface that produced the usage or cost. Null unless product is in group\_by[]; it can also be null on grouped rows whose usage cannot be attributed to a known surface. Values include "chat", "claude\_code", "cowork", "office\_agent", "claude\_in\_chrome", and "claude\_design". Some unattributed usage is reported as "other".

rbac\_group\_id: string

RBAC group (team) the usage is attributed to, in the public tagged `rbac_group_...` spelling — the same spelling the activity resources use for this key, so the same team has ONE id across resources and it round-trips as an `rbac_group_ids[]` filter value. Populated only when `rbac_group_id` is in `group_by[]`. Any-membership semantics: a user in several groups contributes their full usage to each of those groups' rows, so the named-group rows overlap and their sum can exceed the org total. A null value is the single unassigned row: users in no group on that (UTC) day. For the true org total, run the same query with no group\_by.

requests: number

Number of API requests in this row's scope. Null when `group_by` includes `cost_type` or `token_type` (the count has no per-component attribution; read it from the ungrouped response). For sandbox / code-execution events, this counts execution spans rather than HTTP requests (these rows surface with `product: null`).



speed: "fast" or "standard"

One of the following:

"fast"

"standard"

starting\_at: string



token\_type: "cache\_creation.ephemeral\_1h\_input\_tokens" or "cache\_creation.ephemeral\_5m\_input\_tokens" or "cache\_read\_input\_tokens" or 2 more

Token type when cost\_type=tokens; null otherwise.

One of the following:

"cache\_creation.ephemeral\_1h\_input\_tokens"

"cache\_creation.ephemeral\_5m\_input\_tokens"

"cache\_read\_input\_tokens"

"output\_tokens"

"uncached\_input\_tokens"

data\_refreshed\_at: string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the export this response was served from. Data beyond this watermark is incomplete; for stable results, set `ending_at` to this value or earlier. Data is typically refreshed every 4 hours but not final until about 30 days after the usage date (late-arriving events, reconciliation adjustments).

has\_more: boolean

next\_page: string

organization\_id: string

ID of the Organization.
