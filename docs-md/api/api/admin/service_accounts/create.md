# Create Service Account

POST/v1/organizations/service\_accounts

Create a service account.

A service account is a named workload identity that federation rules
target. `organization_role` is `developer` (default) or `admin`; a rule
may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when the
target's `organization_role` is `admin`. Requires an OAuth bearer (user
or WIF-minted service account token) or a Console session; Admin API
keys are not accepted. Creating an `admin`-role service account requires
an interactive credential (a user OAuth token or a Console session) — a
workload may only create `developer`-role service accounts.

When this service account was created.

created\_by\_actor\_id: string

Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this service account.

Optional free-text description.

Admin-chosen slug identifier.



One of the following:
