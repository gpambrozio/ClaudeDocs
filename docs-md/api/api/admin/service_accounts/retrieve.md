# Get Service Account

GET/v1/organizations/service\_accounts/{service\_account\_id}

Retrieve a service account by its ID (`svac_...`).

##### Path parameters

service\_account\_id: string

ID of the service account.

##### Headers



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string

Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

##### Returns



ServiceAccount object{ id, archived\_at, archived\_by\_actor\_id, 8 more }

Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
whatever references it (federation rules).
