##### ReturnsExpand Collapse



ServiceAccount object { id, archived\_at, archived\_by\_actor\_id, 8 more } 

Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
whatever references it (federation rules).

id: string

Tagged ID of the service account.

If set, this service account is archived.

archived\_by\_actor\_id: string

Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this service account.

created\_at: string

When this service account was created.

created\_by\_actor\_id: string

Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this service account.

description: string

Optional free-text description.

name: string

Admin-chosen slug identifier.



organization\_role: "admin" or "developer"

Org-level role. A federation rule may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when this is `admin`. A rule granting `org:admin` whose target is later demoted to `developer` is rejected at token exchange. Rules granting `org:admin` are managed in the Console.

One of the following:

"admin"

"developer"

type: "service\_account"

updated\_at: string

When this service account was last updated.
