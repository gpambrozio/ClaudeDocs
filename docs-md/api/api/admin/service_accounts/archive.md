# Archive Service Account

POST/v1/organizations/service\_accounts/{service\_account\_id}/archive

Archive a service account.

Idempotent; re-archiving returns the service account with its original
`archived_at`. Rejected with 400 if any live (non-archived) federation
rule still targets this service account, same as issuer archival; archive
those rules first or change their target to another service account.

Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys are not
accepted.

##### Path ParametersExpand Collapse

service\_account\_id: string

ID of the service account to archive.

##### Header ParametersExpand Collapse



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string

Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

##### ReturnsExpand Collapse



ServiceAccount object { id, archived\_at, archived\_by\_actor\_id, 8 more } 

Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
whatever references it (federation rules).

id: string

Tagged ID of the service account.

archived\_at: string

If set, this service account is archived.

archived\_by\_actor\_id: string

Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this service account.

created\_at: string

When this service account was created.

created\_by\_actor\_id: string

Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this service account.

description: string

Optional free-text description.

name: string

Admin-chosen slug identifier.



organization\_role: "admin" or "developer"

Org-level role. A federation rule may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when this is `admin`. A rule granting `org:admin` whose target is later demoted to `developer` is rejected at token exchange. Rules granting `org:admin` are managed in the Console.

One of the following:

"admin"

"developer"

type: "service\_account"

updated\_at: string

When this service account was last updated.

updated\_by\_actor\_id: string

Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this service account.
