# List Workspaces For Service Account

GET/v1/organizations/service\_accounts/{service\_account\_id}/workspaces

List the workspaces a service account is a member of.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role` in that
workspace. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. When the
service account has no explicit default-workspace membership, the
implicit (`implicit: true`) membership is returned as the first entry on
the first page; with `limit=1` the first page may return up to 2 entries
(the implicit entry plus one explicit membership) so a pagination cursor
can be derived. Memberships are returned only while
the service account is active; an archived service account returns an
empty list.

##### Path ParametersExpand Collapse

service\_account\_id: string

ID of the service account.

##### Query ParametersExpand Collapse

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.
