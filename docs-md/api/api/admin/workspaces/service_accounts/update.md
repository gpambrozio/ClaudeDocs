# Update Service Account Workspace Member

POST/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace\_id}/service\_accounts/{service\_account\_id}

Change a service account's role in a workspace.

The new `workspace_role` replaces the current one. Only explicit
memberships can be updated; to set a role on the implicit
default-workspace membership, add the service account explicitly with
`POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`. Archived workspaces
return 400. Archived service accounts cannot be updated and are
rejected. Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys
are not accepted.

##### Path parameters

ID of the workspace.

service\_account\_id: string

ID of the service account.

##### Headers



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string

Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.
