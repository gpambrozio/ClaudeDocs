# Get Federation Rule

GET/v1/organizations/federation\_rules/{federation\_rule\_id}

Retrieve a federation rule by its ID (`fdrl_...`).

##### Path parameters

federation\_rule\_id: string

ID of the federation rule.

##### Headers



"anthropic-beta": optional array of string

Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

##### Returns



FederationRule object{ id, applies\_to\_all\_workspaces, archived\_at, 17 more }

Authorization rule binding an external OIDC identity to Anthropic.

Evaluates the match conditions and mints an OAuth access token for the
resolved target, scoped to a single workspace where the rule is enabled
(chosen by the caller at exchange time when the rule is enabled for more
than one). For rules enabled via `workspace_ids` or
`applies_to_all_workspaces`, the target service account must be a member
of that workspace (it is implicitly a member of the default workspace);
rules carrying only the legacy `workspace_id` binding do not enforce
this.
