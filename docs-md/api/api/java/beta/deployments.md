class BetaManagedAgentsCronSchedule:

5-field POSIX cron schedule with computed runtime timestamps.

String expression

5-field POSIX cron expression: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week (e.g., "0 9 \* \* 1-5" for weekdays at 9am). Day-of-week is 0-7 where 0 and 7 both mean Sunday. Extended cron syntax - seconds or year fields, and the special characters L, W, #, and ? - is not supported, nor are predefined shortcuts (@daily).

String timezone

IANA timezone identifier (e.g., "America/Los\_Angeles", "UTC").

Type type

Optional<LocalDateTime> lastRunAt

A timestamp in RFC 3339 format

Optional<List<LocalDateTime>> upcomingRunsAt

Up to 5 timestamps of upcoming cron occurrences. Non-empty for active and paused deployments (reflects what the schedule would do if unpaused); empty once the deployment is archived (`archived_at` set). Each fire is offset by a small per-schedule jitter, so a run will actually start at or shortly after its listed time.
