

BrowserStateBlockParam object{ tabs, type, cache\_control, state\_changes }

The caller's browser state after a browser toolset member call —
the full inventory of open tabs, which tab is active, and any side
effects (tabs opened, download state changes) the call produced.

At most one per `tool_result`, only on a non-error result answering a
browser toolset member `tool_use`. The server renders the
model-visible text from it; the model never sees the raw fields.



BrowserStateChange = [BrowserStateChangeTabOpened](api/http/messages.md) { tab\_id, type } or [BrowserStateChangeDownloadStarted](api/http/messages.md) { download\_id, type, url } or [BrowserStateChangeDownloadCompleted](api/http/messages.md) { download\_id, type, url, 2 more } or [BrowserStateChangeDownloadFailed](api/http/messages.md) { download\_id, type, url, error }

A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —
the creation delta of the `tabs` inventory, not an event log.

Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its
`tabs` entry, which must include the same `tab_id`. A tab opened
during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears
in the next result's `tabs` inventory.

One of the following:



BrowserStateChangeDownloadCompleted object{ download\_id, type, url, 2 more }

A file download that finished during this call, reported with the
same `download_id` as its `download_started` — or without a prior
`download_started`, when the download finished during the call that
started it (at most one state change per `download_id` per result).

BrowserStateChangeTabOpened object{ tab\_id, type }

A tab this call's execution opened that remains open at its end —

Carries only the `tab_id`; the tab's `title` and `url` live on its
`tabs` entry, which must include the same `tab_id`. A tab opened
during a failed call gets no deferred `tab_opened`; it simply appears
in the next result's `tabs` inventory.



BrowserStateTabEntry object{ tab\_id, title, url, active }

One open browser tab reported in a `browser_state` block's `tabs`
inventory.

`tab_id` is the caller-assigned identifier for the tab; `title` and
`url` describe the page the tab is currently showing and may be empty
strings (a blank tab legitimately has both empty). `active` marks the
tab that is active after this call; whenever `tabs` is non-empty,
exactly one entry is marked.





defer\_loading: optional boolean or null



BrowserToolset20260801 object{ type, cache\_control, configs }

The browser toolset: a single `tools[]` entry (carrying no
`name`) that declares the browser tool family. The model is served
the family's tool with any members disabled via `configs` removed
from its schema.



BrowserToolsetConfigs object{ close\_tab, double\_click, file\_upload, 28 more }

Per-member configuration for `browser_toolset_20260801`: one
optional field per member tool, keyed by the member name — the same
name the member's `tool_use` blocks carry. Every member is an
accepted key, and a member's defaults apply wherever its key is
absent. Unknown keys are rejected: the field set is this toolset
version's complete member set.

The request could assist the development of competing AI models, which is restricted under [Anthropic's commercial terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms). Benign machine learning work can also trigger this category.

"reasoning\_extraction"

The request asks the model to reproduce its internal reasoning in the response text. To get reasoning in a structured form instead, use [adaptive thinking](build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking.md).

"general\_harms"

The request could be related to an area that was determined as harmful. Benign work might sometimes trigger this category.
