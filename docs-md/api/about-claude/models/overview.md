##  Choosing a model

If you're unsure which model to use, start with **Claude Opus 5** for complex agentic coding and enterprise work. For workloads that need the highest available capability, use [Claude Fable 5](#claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5).

All current Claude models support text and image input, text output, multilingual capabilities, and vision. Models are available through the Claude API, [Amazon Bedrock](build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock.md), [Claude Platform on AWS](build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws.md), [Google Cloud](build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai.md), and [Microsoft Foundry](build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry.md).

Once you've picked a model, [learn how to make your first API call](get-started.md).

###  Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5

Claude Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`) is Anthropic's most capable widely released model. Claude Mythos 5 (`claude-mythos-5`) shares Claude Fable 5's specs and pricing and joins the invitation-only Claude Mythos Preview (`claude-mythos-preview`) within [Project Glasswing](https://anthropic.com/glasswing). See [Introducing Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5](about-claude/models/introducing-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5.md) for launch details and API changes.

Claude Fable 5 is available on the Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, Claude Platform on AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Foundry beginning June 9, 2026.

### Legacy models

##  Prompt and output performance

Current Claude models excel in:

- **Performance:** Top-tier results in reasoning, coding, multilingual tasks, long-context handling, honesty, and image processing. See [Prompting best practices](build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices.md) for general and model-specific prompting guidance.
- **Engaging responses:** Claude models are ideal for applications that require rich, human-like interactions.

  - If you prefer more concise responses, you can adjust your prompts to guide the model toward the desired output length. Refer to the [prompt engineering guides](build-with-claude/prompt-engineering.md) for details.
  - For prompting best practices, see [Prompting best practices](build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices.md).
- **Output quality:** When migrating from a previous model generation, you may notice larger improvements in overall performance.
