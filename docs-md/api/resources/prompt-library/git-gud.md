| User | I have made some changes to my local files and I want to save them in my local Git repository. What Git command should I use? |

## Example Output

To save the changes you've made to your local files in your local Git repository, you should use the following Git commands:

1. `git add .` or `git add <file>`

   - This command stages the changes you've made, preparing them to be committed. The `.` adds all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. If you only want to stage specific files, replace `.` with the file name or path.
2. `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

   - This command commits the staged changes to your local Git repository. The `-m` flag allows you to provide a commit message describing the changes you've made. Replace `"Your commit message"` with a brief, descriptive summary of your changes.

For example, if you've made changes to a file named `example.txt`, you would run:

```inline-block
git add example.txt
git commit -m "Update example.txt with new content"
```

These commands will save your changes in your local Git repository, creating a new commit with the provided message. You can later push these changes to a remote repository or continue working on your local branch.

Remember to run these commands from within your Git repository directory in your terminal or command prompt.
