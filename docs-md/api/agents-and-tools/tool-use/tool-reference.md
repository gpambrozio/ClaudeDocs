# Tool reference

Copy page

This page is a reference for the tools Anthropic provides and the optional properties you can set on any tool definition. For a conceptual introduction to tool use, see [Tool use with Claude](agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview.md). For guidance on implementing tool use in your application, see [Define tools](agents-and-tools/tool-use/define-tools.md).

## Anthropic-provided tools

Anthropic provides two kinds of tools: **server tools** that execute on Anthropic's infrastructure, and **client tools** where Anthropic defines the schema but your application handles execution. Both kinds appear in your request's `tools` array alongside any user-defined tools.

| Tool | `type` | Execution | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Web search tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool.md) | `web_search_20260209` `web_search_20250305` | Server | GA |
| [Web fetch tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool.md) | `web_fetch_20260209` `web_fetch_20250910` | Server | GA |
| [Code execution tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool.md) | `code_execution_20260120` `code_execution_20250825` | Server | GA |
| [Tool search tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool.md) | `tool_search_tool_regex_20251119` `tool_search_tool_bm25_20251119` | Server | GA |
| [MCP connector](agents-and-tools/mcp-connector.md) | `mcp_toolset` | Server | Beta: `mcp-client-2025-11-20` |
| [Memory tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool.md) | `memory_20250818` | Client | GA |
| [Bash tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/bash-tool.md) | `bash_20250124` | Client | GA |
| [Text editor tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool.md) | `text_editor_20250728` `text_editor_20250124` | Client | GA |
| [Computer use tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool.md) | `computer_20251124` `computer_20250124` | Client | Beta: `computer-use-2025-11-24` `computer-use-2025-01-24` |

For model compatibility, see each tool's page. Supported models vary by tool and by tool version.

The tool search `type` values also accept undated aliases: `tool_search_tool_regex` and `tool_search_tool_bm25`. These resolve to the latest dated version.

### Tool versioning

Most Anthropic-provided tools carry a `_YYYYMMDD` suffix in the `type` string. A new version is released when the tool's behavior, schema, or model support changes. Older versions remain available so that existing integrations continue to work.

When a tool has multiple active versions, the relationship between them varies:

- **Capability-keyed:** `web_search_20260209` and `web_fetch_20260209` add dynamic content filtering over their predecessors. `code_execution_20260120` adds [programmatic tool calling](agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling.md) from within the sandbox. In each case, both the new and old versions are current; which one you use depends on whether you need the new capability.
- **Model-keyed:** `text_editor_20250728` is for Claude 4 models and `text_editor_20250124` is for earlier models. The version you use depends on the model you target.
- **Variant, not version:** `tool_search_tool_regex_20251119` and `tool_search_tool_bm25_20251119` are two search algorithms released together. Neither supersedes the other.
- **Legacy:** `code_execution_20250522` supports only Python. `code_execution_20250825` adds Bash and file operations.

The `mcp_toolset` type is not date-versioned; versioning is carried in the `anthropic-beta` header instead.

## Tool definition properties

Every tool in the `tools` array, including user-defined tools, accepts optional properties that control how the tool is loaded, who can call it, and how its inputs are validated. These properties compose: you can set `defer_loading` and `cache_control` and `strict` on the same tool.

| Property | Purpose | Available on | Detailed guide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cache_control` | Set a prompt-cache breakpoint at this tool definition | All tools | [Prompt caching](build-with-claude/prompt-caching.md) |
| `strict` | Guarantee schema validation on tool names and inputs | All tools except `mcp_toolset` | [Strict tool use](agents-and-tools/tool-use/strict-tool-use.md) |
| `defer_loading` | Exclude the tool from the initial system prompt; load it on demand when tool search returns a `tool_reference` for it | All tools (for `mcp_toolset`, see [tool configuration](agents-and-tools/mcp-connector.md)) | [Tool search tool](agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool.md) |
| `allowed_callers` | Restrict which callers can call the tool | All tools except `mcp_toolset` | [Programmatic tool calling](agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling.md) |
| `input_examples` | Provide example input objects to help Claude understand how to call the tool | User-defined and Anthropic-schema client tools. Not available on server tools. | [Define tools](agents-and-tools/tool-use/define-tools.md) |
| `eager_input_streaming` | Enable fine-grained input streaming (`true`) or keep standard buffered streaming (`false`) for this tool | User-defined tools only | [Fine-grained tool streaming](agents-and-tools/tool-use/fine-grained-tool-streaming.md) |

### `allowed_callers` values

`allowed_callers` is an array that accepts any combination of:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"direct"` | The model can call this tool directly in a `tool_use` block. This is the default if `allowed_callers` is omitted. |
| `"code_execution_20260120"` | Code running inside a `code_execution_20260120` sandbox can call this tool. |

Omitting `"direct"` from the array (for example, `"allowed_callers": ["code_execution_20260120"]`) means the tool is callable only from within code execution. The response's `tool_use` block includes a `caller` field that identifies which caller called the tool. See [Programmatic tool calling](agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling.md) for the full treatment, including the `caller` response shape and error behavior.

### `defer_loading` and prompt caching

Tools with `defer_loading: true` are stripped from the rendered tools section before the cache key is computed. They don't appear in the system-prompt prefix at all. When tool search discovers a deferred tool and returns a `tool_reference` for it, the tool's full definition is expanded inline at that point in the conversation body, not in the prefix.

This means `defer_loading: true` preserves your prompt cache. You can add deferred tools to a request without invalidating an existing cache entry, and the cache remains valid across the turn where the tool is discovered and the turn where it's called.

For how to combine `defer_loading` with `cache_control` breakpoints, see the [Tool search tool prompt caching guidance](agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool.md).
