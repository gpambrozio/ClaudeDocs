# Deploy MCP tunnels with Docker Compose

Copy page

MCP tunnels are in research preview. [Request access](https://claude.com/form/claude-managed-agents) to try them.

This guide deploys the [tunnel stack](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts.md) as hardened containers on a single host. The same configuration can be replicated across multiple hosts for availability.

## Before you begin

You need:

- **A tunnel created in the Console.** Follow [Create a tunnel](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console.md) and record the tunnel ID (`tnl_...`).
- **A way for the host to authenticate to the Tunnels API.**
  - **Programmatic access (recommended).** Turn on **Set up programmatic access** when creating the tunnel so the [setup component](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts.md) can authenticate through Workload Identity Federation. Record the federation rule ID (`fdrl_...`) and your organization ID.
  - **Manual.** Skip programmatic access. You'll [get the tunnel token from the Console](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console.md), generate a CA and server certificate yourself, and [register the CA in the Console](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console.md).
- **A host with Docker and Docker Compose** installed. The manual flow also requires `openssl` (1.1.1 or newer).
- **Outbound network connectivity** from the host to `api.anthropic.com` (443 TCP) and the [tunnel edge](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts.md) (7844 TCP and UDP). See the full [network requirements](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/overview.md).
- **One or more MCP servers** running and reachable from the host on the addresses you'll configure under `routes`. If you don't have one yet, [use the sample server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server).

## Optional: Use a sample MCP server

If you don't have an MCP server available for testing, use this minimal one:

```shiki
mkdir -p mcp-tunnel
cat > mcp-tunnel/hello_server.py <<'EOF'
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("hello-server", host="0.0.0.0", port=9000)

@mcp.tool()
def hello(name: str = "world") -> str:
    """Say hello to someone."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")
EOF
```

The following Install steps `cd` into `mcp-tunnel/` and note where to add the corresponding service and route.

## Install

This guide provides one reference approach using Docker Compose. You are responsible for adapting it to meet your organization's security requirements.

With programmatic access

With programmatic access

Without programmatic access

Without programmatic access

This path requires the host to have an OIDC identity provider (such as a cloud VM metadata server or SPIFFE). If it doesn't, use the **Without programmatic access** tab instead.

The setup component uses Workload Identity Federation to fetch the tunnel token, generate a CA and server certificate, and register the CA with Anthropic.

1. 1

   Prepare the deployment directory

   ```shiki
   mkdir -p mcp-tunnel/{config,data}
   cd mcp-tunnel
   sudo chown 65532:65532 data
   ```

   

   The containers run as the non-root UID `65532` and need write access to `data/`.
2. 2

   Write docker-compose.yaml

   The compose file pins images by SHA-256 digest, runs every container as non-root with a read-only filesystem, drops all Linux capabilities, and disables privilege escalation.

   ```shiki
   cat > docker-compose.yaml <<'EOF'
   services:
     setup:
       image: us-docker.pkg.dev/anthropic-public-registry/images/mcp-proxy@sha256:6b9adedbf2763143ec72f106ecaf0ce7fd3294e89b208f54a1db97a33d14c5ba

       environment:
         - TUNNEL_ID
         - ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID

       command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run --url http://localhost:8080

   EOF
   ```

   

   If you're using the [sample MCP server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server), append it as a service:

   ```shiki
   cat >> docker-compose.yaml <<'EOF'

     hello-mcp:
       image: python:3.13-slim
       working_dir: /app
       volumes:
         - ./hello_server.py:/app/hello_server.py:ro
       command: sh -c "pip install --quiet mcp && python hello_server.py"
       restart: unless-stopped
   EOF
   ```

   
3. 3

   Provision the tunnel

   Set the identifiers from the [Console create-tunnel flow](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console.md):

   ```shiki
   export TUNNEL_ID=tnl_...
   export ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID=fdrl_...
   export ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
   ```

   

   If your federation rule is scoped to a workspace other than your organization's default, also set `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID=wrkspc_...`; the setup component uses the default workspace otherwise.

   Set `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN` to an OIDC JWT from this host's identity provider. Follow the [WIF guide for your provider](manage-claude/workload-identity-federation.md) to register the issuer, set the rule's subject, and mint the token; the rule's audience must match the audience you request when minting.

   Run the setup component:

   ```shiki
   docker compose run --rm setup
   ```

   

   `setup init` is idempotent over `data/`: re-running it reuses the existing CA and skips registration. A new CA is generated and registered only when `data/` is empty or `TUNNEL_ID` has changed; in that case the cap of two active certificates applies, so revoke one in the Console first if both slots are filled.

   See [Setup component authentication failures](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/troubleshooting.md) if it errors.

   Retrieve your tunnel domain and export it for later steps:

   ```shiki
   export TUNNEL_DOMAIN=$(sudo cat data/tunnel-domain)
   echo "$TUNNEL_DOMAIN"
   ```

   

   Workload Identity Federation tokens are short-lived (one hour by default) and expire automatically; there is nothing to revoke after setup completes.
4. 4

   Write the proxy config

   `tunnel_domain` is **required**: the [proxy](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts.md) uses it to strip the domain suffix from incoming hostnames before looking up the subdomain in `routes`. `routes` is a flat map from subdomain to upstream URL, not a list.

   ```shiki
   cat > config/mcp-proxy.yaml <<EOF
   listen_addr: ":8080"
   log_level: info
   shutdown_timeout: 30s
   tunnel_domain: ${TUNNEL_DOMAIN}
   tls:
     cert_file: /data/tls.crt
     key_file: /data/tls.key
   routes:
     echo: http://hello-mcp:9000
   EOF
   ```

   

   The `echo:` route targets the [sample MCP server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server); replace it with (or add) your own routes. See the [proxy configuration](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/reference.md) reference for all available fields.
5. 5

   Start the deployment

   ```shiki
   export TUNNEL_TOKEN=$(sudo cat data/tunnel-token)
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   

The compose file reads `TUNNEL_TOKEN` from the host environment with no default, so the export must be repeated in every fresh shell and after a reboot.

For a multi-VM deployment, copy the `mcp-tunnel/` directory to each host, set `TUNNEL_TOKEN`, and run `docker compose up -d`. In the programmatic flow `TUNNEL_TOKEN` is `$(sudo cat data/tunnel-token)`; in the manual flow it's the value you copied from the Console. The same tunnel token and certificates work across all replicas.

## Verify the deployment

Verify end to end by calling an [upstream MCP server](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts.md) from Anthropic's side: see [Use the tunneled MCP servers](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/overview.md). With the [sample MCP server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server), the routed URL is `https://echo.<your-tunnel-domain>/mcp`. If verification fails, see [Troubleshooting](agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/troubleshooting.md).

## Upgrades

Run the commands in this section from inside the `mcp-tunnel/` deployment directory.

### Rotate the tunnel token

With programmatic access, increment `--token-version` in the `setup` service command, set the Workload Identity Federation identifiers, mint a fresh OIDC JWT, and re-run the setup component:

```shiki
# Edit docker-compose.yaml: increment the integer in the setup service's
# --token-version argument (for example, --token-version=1 to
# --token-version=2). The setup binary refuses to rotate when the value
# hasn't changed.

export TUNNEL_ID=tnl_...
export ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID=fdrl_...
export ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
# export ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID=wrkspc_...   # if your rule is workspace-scoped
# Re-mint ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN per the WIF provider guide for your
# environment (it will have expired since install).
export ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN=...

docker compose run --rm setup

export TUNNEL_TOKEN=$(sudo cat data/tunnel-token)
docker compose up -d cloudflared
```



The `--token-version` argument is edited in `docker-compose.yaml` rather than passed on the command line so the new value persists for future runs of the setup component. The setup component authenticates with Workload Identity Federation; there is no API token to revoke.

Without programmatic access, click **Rotate token** on the tunnel detail page in the Console, then update the `TUNNEL_TOKEN` environment variable on each host and restart cloudflared (`docker compose up -d cloudflared`).

Clicking **Rotate token** invalidates the current token immediately. Between that moment and updating `TUNNEL_TOKEN` on every host and restarting cloudflared, any host whose cloudflared restarts (crash, host reboot) cannot reconnect. Update each host promptly after rotating.

### Certificate renewal

You're responsible for monitoring expiry and renewing the server certificate before it expires.

With programmatic access:

```shiki
docker compose run --rm setup renew-cert --output=dir:/data
```



The CLI arguments replace the `setup` service's `command` (the `init` arguments) but keep its `entrypoint`, so this runs `/setup renew-cert --output=dir:/data`.

Pass `--renew-before=720h` to make the command a no-op when more than 30 days of validity remain. This makes it safe to run on a fixed schedule.

Without programmatic access, sign a new server certificate with your existing CA (the CA registered in the Console doesn't change) and replace `data/tls.crt`. Set `TUNNEL_DOMAIN` first if you're running this from a fresh shell.

```shiki
export TUNNEL_DOMAIN=YOUR_TUNNEL_DOMAIN_HERE
openssl req -new -key data/tls.key -out /tmp/server.csr \
  -subj "/CN=${TUNNEL_DOMAIN}"
openssl x509 -req -in /tmp/server.csr \
  -CA data/ca.crt -CAkey data/ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out data/tls.crt -days 90 \
  -extfile data/tls.ext
```



In either flow the proxy polls `tls.cert_file` and reloads it automatically, so no restart is required.
