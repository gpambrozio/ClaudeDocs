Commands control Claude Code from inside a session. They provide a quick way to switch models, manage permissions, clear context, run a workflow, and more.
Type `/` to see every command available to you, or type `/` followed by letters to filter.
A command is only recognized at the start of your message. Text that follows the command name is passed to it as arguments.

## [​](#commands-across-a-typical-workflow) Commands across a typical workflow

Most commands are useful at a specific point in a session, from setting up a project to shipping a change.
**First session in a repo.** Run `/init` to generate a starter `CLAUDE.md`, then `/memory` to refine it. Use `/mcp` and `/agents` to set up any servers or subagents the project needs, and `/permissions` to set the approval rules you want.
**During a task.** `/plan` switches into plan mode before a large change. `/model` and `/effort` adjust how much reasoning you’re spending. When the conversation gets long, `/context` shows where the window is going and `/compact` summarizes it down; use `/btw` for a quick aside that shouldn’t bloat history.
**Running work in parallel.** `/agents` opens the manager for the [subagents](sub-agents.md) Claude can delegate side tasks to, and `/tasks` lists what’s running in the background of the current session. `/background` detaches the whole session to keep running as a [background agent](agent-view.md) and frees your terminal. For a large change that spans the codebase, `/batch` decomposes it into independent units and runs each in its own [worktree](worktrees.md). See [Run agents in parallel](agents.md) for how these approaches relate.
**Before you ship.** `/diff` shows what changed, `/code-review` checks the diff for correctness bugs, and `/review` or `/security-review` give a deeper read-only pass.
**Between sessions.** `/clear` starts fresh on a new task while keeping project memory. `/resume` and `/branch` let you return to or fork an earlier conversation. `/teleport` pulls a web session into this terminal, and `/remote-control` lets you continue this local session from another device.
**When something is wrong.** `/rewind` rolls code and conversation back to a checkpoint, or summarizes part of the conversation. `/doctor` and `/debug` diagnose install and runtime issues, and `/feedback` reports a bug with session context attached.

## [​](#all-commands) All commands

The table below lists all the commands included in Claude Code. Entries marked **[Skill](skills.md)** are bundled skills. They use the same mechanism as skills you write yourself: a prompt handed to Claude, which Claude can also invoke automatically when relevant. Everything else is a built-in command whose behavior is coded into the CLI. To add your own commands, see [skills](skills.md).
In the table below, `<arg>` indicates a required argument and `[arg]` indicates an optional one.

Not every command appears for every user. Availability depends on your platform, plan, and environment. For example, `/desktop` only shows on macOS and Windows when signed in with a Claude subscription, and `/upgrade` only shows on Pro and Max plans.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/add-dir <path>` | Add a working directory for file access during the current session. Most `.claude/` configuration is [not discovered](permissions.md) from the added directory. You can later resume the session from the added directory with `--continue` or `--resume` |
| `/agents` | Manage [agent](sub-agents.md) configurations |
| `/autofix-pr [prompt]` | Spawn a [Claude Code on the web](claude-code-on-the-web.md) session that watches the current branch’s PR and pushes fixes when CI fails or reviewers leave comments. Detects the open PR from your checked-out branch with `gh pr view`; to watch a different PR, check out its branch first. By default the remote session is told to fix every CI failure and review comment; pass a prompt to give it different instructions, for example `/autofix-pr only fix lint and type errors`. Requires the `gh` CLI and access to [Claude Code on the web](claude-code-on-the-web.md) |
| `/background [prompt]` | Detach the current session to run as a [background agent](agent-view.md) and free this terminal. Pass a prompt to send one more instruction before detaching. Monitor the session with `claude agents`. Alias: `/bg` |
| `/batch <instruction>` | **[Skill](skills.md).** Orchestrate large-scale changes across a codebase in parallel. Researches the codebase, decomposes the work into 5 to 30 independent units, and presents a plan. Once approved, spawns one [background subagent](sub-agents.md) per unit in an isolated [git worktree](worktrees.md). Each subagent implements its unit, runs tests, and opens a pull request. Requires a git repository. Example: `/batch migrate src/ from Solid to React` |
| `/branch [name]` | Create a branch of the current conversation at this point. Switches you into the branch and preserves the original, which you can return to with `/resume`. Alias: `/fork`. When [`CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT`](env-vars.md) is set, `/fork` instead spawns a [forked subagent](sub-agents.md) and is no longer an alias for this command |
| `/btw <question>` | Ask a quick [side question](interactive-mode.md) without adding to the conversation |
| `/chrome` | Configure [Claude in Chrome](chrome.md) settings |
| `/claude-api [migrate|managed-agents-onboard]` | **[Skill](skills.md).** Load Claude API reference material for your project’s language (Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, C#, PHP, or cURL) and Managed Agents reference. Covers tool use, streaming, batches, structured outputs, and common pitfalls. Also activates automatically when your code imports `anthropic` or `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. Run `/claude-api migrate` to upgrade existing Claude API code to a newer model: Claude asks which files to scan and which model to target, then updates model IDs, thinking configuration, and other parameters that changed between versions. Run `/claude-api managed-agents-onboard` for an interactive walkthrough that creates a new Managed Agent from scratch |
| `/clear [name]` | Start a new conversation with empty context. The previous conversation stays available in `/resume`. Pass a name to label the previous conversation in the `/resume` picker. To free up context while continuing the same conversation, use `/compact` instead. Aliases: `/reset`, `/new` |
| `/code-review [low|medium|high|xhigh|max] [--comment] [target]` | **[Skill](skills.md).** Review the current diff for correctness bugs and report findings without editing files. Lower [effort levels](model-config.md) return fewer, higher-confidence findings, while `high` through `max` give broader coverage and may include uncertain findings. Without an effort argument, the review uses the session’s current effort. Pass `--comment` to post findings as inline comments on the current GitHub PR. Pass a path or PR reference to review a specific target. Formerly `/simplify`, which still works as an alias |
| `/color [color|default]` | Set the prompt bar color for the current session. Available colors: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`, `pink`, `cyan`. Use `default` to reset, or run with no argument to pick a random color. When [Remote Control](remote-control.md) is connected, the color syncs to claude.ai/code |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Free up context by summarizing the conversation so far. Optionally pass focus instructions for the summary. See [how compaction handles rules, skills, and memory files](context-window.md) |
| `/config` | Open the [Settings](settings.md) interface to adjust theme, model, [output style](output-styles.md), and other preferences. Alias: `/settings` |
| `/context [all]` | Visualize current context usage as a colored grid. Shows optimization suggestions for context-heavy tools, memory bloat, and capacity warnings. In [fullscreen mode](fullscreen.md) the per-item breakdown is collapsed to keep the grid visible. Pass `all` to expand it |
| `/copy [N]` | Copy the last assistant response to clipboard. Pass a number `N` to copy the Nth-latest response: `/copy 2` copies the second-to-last. When code blocks are present, shows an interactive picker to select individual blocks or the full response. Press `w` in the picker to write the selection to a file instead of the clipboard, which is useful over SSH |
| `/cost` | Alias for `/usage` |
| `/debug [description]` | **[Skill](skills.md).** Enable debug logging for the current session and troubleshoot issues by reading the session debug log. Debug logging is off by default unless you started with `claude --debug`, so running `/debug` mid-session starts capturing logs from that point forward. Optionally describe the issue to focus the analysis |
| `/desktop` | Continue the current session in the Claude Code Desktop app. Requires macOS or Windows and a Claude subscription. Alias: `/app` |
| `/diff` | Open an interactive diff viewer showing uncommitted changes and per-turn diffs. Use left/right arrows to switch between the current git diff and individual Claude turns, and up/down to browse files |
| `/doctor` | Diagnose and verify your Claude Code installation and settings. Results show with status icons. Press `f` to have Claude fix any reported issues |
| `/effort [level|auto]` | Set the model [effort level](model-config.md). Accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`; available levels depend on the model and `max` is session-only. `auto` resets to the model default. Without an argument, opens an interactive slider; use left and right arrows to pick a level and `Enter` to apply. Takes effect immediately without waiting for the current response to finish |
| `/exit` | Exit the CLI. In an attached [background session](agent-view.md), this detaches and the session keeps running. Alias: `/quit` |
| `/export [filename]` | Export the current conversation as plain text. With a filename, writes directly to that file. Without, opens a dialog to copy to clipboard or save to a file |
| `/fast [on|off]` | Toggle [fast mode](fast-mode.md) on or off |
| `/feedback [report]` | Submit feedback, report a bug, or share your conversation. Aliases: `/bug`, `/share` |
| `/fewer-permission-prompts` | **[Skill](skills.md).** Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project `.claude/settings.json` to reduce permission prompts |
| `/focus` | Toggle the focus view, which shows only your last prompt, a one-line tool-call summary with edit diffstats, and the final response. The selection persists across sessions; set [`viewMode`](settings.md) in settings to override it. Only available in [fullscreen rendering](fullscreen.md) |
| `/goal [condition|clear]` | Set a [goal](goal.md): Claude keeps working across turns until the condition is met. With no argument, shows the current or most recently achieved goal. `clear`, `stop`, `off`, `reset`, `none`, or `cancel` removes an active goal early |
| `/heapdump` | Write a JavaScript heap snapshot and a memory breakdown to `~/Desktop`, or your home directory on Linux without a Desktop folder, for diagnosing high memory usage. See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) |
| `/help` | Show help and available commands |
| `/hooks` | View [hook](hooks.md) configurations for tool events |

| `/login` | Sign in to your Anthropic account |
| `/logout` | Sign out from your Anthropic account |
| `/loop [interval] [prompt]` | **[Skill](skills.md).** Run a prompt repeatedly while the session stays open. Omit the interval and Claude self-paces between iterations. Omit the prompt and, [where available](scheduled-tasks.md), Claude runs an autonomous maintenance check or the prompt in `.claude/loop.md`. Example: `/loop 5m check if the deploy finished`. See [Run prompts on a schedule](scheduled-tasks.md). Alias: `/proactive` |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP server connections and OAuth authentication |
| `/memory` | Edit `CLAUDE.md` memory files, enable or disable [auto-memory](memory.md), and view auto-memory entries |
| `/mobile` | Show QR code to download the Claude mobile app. Aliases: `/ios`, `/android` |
| `/model [model]` | Set the AI model for the current session. For models that support it, use left/right arrows to [adjust effort level](model-config.md). With no argument, opens a picker; press `d` on a row to also save that model as the default for new sessions. The picker asks for confirmation when the conversation has prior output, since the next response re-reads the full history without cached context. Once confirmed, the change applies without waiting for the current response to finish |
| `/passes` | Share a free week of Claude Code with friends. Only visible if your account is eligible |
| `/permissions` | Manage allow, ask, and deny rules for tool permissions. Opens an interactive dialog where you can view rules by scope, add or remove rules, manage working directories, and review [recent auto mode denials](auto-mode-config.md). Alias: `/allowed-tools` |
