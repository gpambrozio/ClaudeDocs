# Built-in commands

Type `/` in Claude Code to see all available commands, or type `/` followed by any letters to filter. Not all commands are visible to every user. Some depend on your platform, plan, or environment. For example, `/desktop` only appears on macOS and Windows, `/upgrade` and `/privacy-settings` are only available on Pro and Max plans, and `/terminal-setup` is hidden when your terminal natively supports its keybindings.
Claude Code also includes [bundled skills](skills.md) like `/simplify`, `/batch`, `/debug`, and `/loop` that appear alongside built-in commands when you type `/`. To create your own commands, see [skills](skills.md).
In the table below, `<arg>` indicates a required argument and `[arg]` indicates an optional one.

| `/copy [N]` | Copy the last assistant response to clipboard. Pass a number `N` to copy the Nth-latest response: `/copy 2` copies the second-to-last.

## [​](#mcp-prompts) MCP prompts

MCP servers can expose prompts that appear as commands. These use the format `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` and are dynamically discovered from connected servers. See [MCP prompts](mcp.md) for details.
