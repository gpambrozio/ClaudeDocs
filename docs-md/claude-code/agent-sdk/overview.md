# Agent SDK overview

> Build production AI agents with Claude Code as a library

An agent is an application that completes a task by planning its own steps and calling tools that read files, run commands, or edit code. The Agent SDK gives you the same tools, [agent loop](agent-loop.md), and context management that power Claude Code, programmable in Python and TypeScript.

## Compare the Agent SDK to other Claude tools

The Agent SDK, the CLI, the Client SDK, and Managed Agents differ in who runs the agent, what comes built in, and how you reach it. Find the row that matches how you want to build and run yours.

## Get started

Follow the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to install the SDK, set your API key, and build your first agent, one that finds and fixes bugs in existing code.

Unless previously approved, Anthropic does not allow third party developers to offer claude.ai login or rate limits for their products, including agents built on the Claude Agent SDK. Use the API key authentication methods described in the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) instead.

## Branding guidelines

For partners integrating the Claude Agent SDK, use of Claude branding is optional. When referencing Claude in your product:

**Allowed:**

* "Claude Agent", preferred for dropdown menus
* "Claude", when within a menu already labeled "Agents"
* "\{YourAgentName} Powered by Claude", if you have an existing agent name

**Not permitted:**

* "Claude Code" or "Claude Code Agent"
* Claude Code-branded ASCII art or visual elements that mimic Claude Code

Your product should maintain its own branding and not appear to be Claude Code or any Anthropic product. For questions about branding compliance, contact the Anthropic [sales team](https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales).
