# Explore the context window

Claude Code’s context window holds everything Claude knows about your session: your instructions, the files it reads, its own responses, and content that never appears in your terminal. The timeline below walks through what loads and when. See [the written breakdown](#what-the-timeline-shows) for the same content as a list.

This interactive timeline works best on a larger screen. See [the written breakdown below](#what-the-timeline-shows) for the same concepts.

Key takeaway

A lot loads before you type anything. CLAUDE.md, memory, skills, and MCP tools are all in context before your first prompt.

## [​](#what-the-timeline-shows) What the timeline shows

The session walks through a realistic flow with representative token counts:

- **Before you type anything**: CLAUDE.md, auto memory, MCP tool names, and skill descriptions all load into context. Your own setup may add more here, like an [output style](output-styles.md) or text from [`--append-system-prompt`](cli-reference.md), which both go into the system prompt the same way.
- **As Claude works**: each file read adds to context, [path-scoped rules](memory.md) load automatically alongside matching files, and a [PostToolUse hook](hooks-guide.md) fires after each edit.
- **The follow-up prompt**: a [subagent](sub-agents.md) handles the research in its own separate context window, so the large file reads stay out of yours. Only the summary and a small metadata trailer come back.
- **At the end**: `/compact` replaces the conversation with a structured summary. Most startup content reloads automatically. The [skill](skills.md) listing is the one exception.

## [​](#check-your-own-session) Check your own session

The visualization uses representative numbers. To see your actual context usage at any point, run `/context` for a live breakdown by category with optimization suggestions. Run `/memory` to check which CLAUDE.md and auto memory files loaded at startup.
