# Feature availability

The Claude Code CLI and everything that runs locally work identically on every provider. For setup instructions per provider, see the [Enterprise deployment overview](third-party-integrations.md). To skip straight to what is missing on your provider, see the [summary by provider](#summary-by-provider) tabs.
In the tables below, ✓ means available, ✗ means not available, and “See note” links to a footnote for partial support. A qualifier after ✓ narrows availability to that subset, and “Admin-enabled” means the feature is off until an organization admin turns it on.

## [​](#availability-by-model-provider) Availability by model provider

How you authenticate determines which features Claude Code can reach. For a single list of what is missing on your provider, see the [summary by provider](#summary-by-provider) tabs. To find your column in the tables:

- **Claude subscription**: you sign in with a claude.ai account on the Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan
- **Anthropic Console**: you authenticate with an Anthropic API key
- **Amazon Bedrock**: you use Claude models from the Bedrock model catalog and set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`. The [Mantle endpoint](amazon-bedrock.md) (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_MANTLE`) is covered by this column
- **Claude Platform on AWS**: you bought Claude through AWS Marketplace but call the Anthropic API, and set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_ANTHROPIC_AWS`
- **Google Vertex AI**: Google-operated; you set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`
- **Microsoft Foundry**: Anthropic-operated on Azure; you set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY`

### [​](#features-available-on-every-provider) Features available on every provider

These work identically on every provider:

- [CLI](quickstart.md) and [Agent SDK](agent-sdk/overview.md)
- [VS Code](vs-code.md) and [JetBrains](jetbrains.md) extensions
- [Subagents](sub-agents.md), [hooks](hooks-guide.md), [commands](commands.md), and [skills](skills.md)
- [CLAUDE.md memory](memory.md), [plugins](plugins.md), and [MCP servers](mcp.md)
- [Checkpoints](checkpointing.md), [sandboxing](sandboxing.md), and [Workflows](workflows.md)
- [OpenTelemetry metrics](monitoring-usage.md) and the [managed settings file](settings.md)

### [​](#features-that-require-a-claude-subscription) Features that require a Claude subscription

These require signing in with a claude.ai account and are not reachable with an Anthropic Console API key or from a third-party provider:

- [Claude Code on the web](claude-code-on-the-web.md), Claude Code on mobile, and [Claude Code in Slack](slack.md)
- [Claude Code Desktop](desktop.md)
- [Routines](routines.md) (`/schedule`)
- [Ultraplan](ultraplan.md) and [Ultrareview](ultrareview.md)
- [Code Review](code-review.md): Team and Enterprise plans
- [Remote Control](remote-control.md)
- [Chrome extension](chrome.md)
- [Computer use](computer-use.md): Pro and Max plans
- [Artifacts](artifacts.md): Team and Enterprise plans
- [Voice dictation](voice-dictation.md)

Desktop is the partial exception: Enterprise deployments can route Desktop to Vertex AI or a gateway provider via [managed settings](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12622667-enterprise-configuration), and the [Cowork on 3P research preview](https://claude.com/docs/cowork/3p/overview) runs the Code tab on Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry, or a self-hosted LLM gateway. For per-plan availability of these features, see [Availability by subscription plan](#availability-by-subscription-plan).

### [​](#cli-capabilities-that-vary-by-provider) CLI capabilities that vary by provider

These features work in the local CLI but depend on a server-side capability that not every provider exposes.

| Feature | Claude subscription | Anthropic Console | Amazon Bedrock | Claude Platform on AWS | Google Vertex AI | Microsoft Foundry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Web search](tools-reference.md) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | See note [1](#fn1) | ✓ |
| [Fast mode](fast-mode.md) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Auto mode](auto-mode-config.md) | ✓ | ✓ | See note [2](#fn2) | ✓ | See note [2](#fn2) | See note [2](#fn2) |
| [Advisor](advisor.md) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Channels](channels.md) | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [`/loop` scheduled tasks](scheduled-tasks.md) | ✓ | ✓ | See note [3](#fn3) | ✓ | See note [3](#fn3) | See note [3](#fn3) |
| [GitHub Actions](github-actions.md) and [GitLab CI/CD](gitlab-ci-cd.md) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

### [​](#admin-and-analytics) Admin and analytics

Organization-level controls and usage visibility.

| Feature | Claude subscription | Anthropic Console | Amazon Bedrock | Claude Platform on AWS | Google Vertex AI | Microsoft Foundry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Analytics dashboard and API](analytics.md) | ✓ (Team and Enterprise) | ✓ [5](#fn5) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Server-managed settings](server-managed-settings.md) | ✓ (Team and Enterprise) | ✓ (Team and Enterprise) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| [Zero Data Retention](zero-data-retention.md) | ✓ (qualified Enterprise accounts) | ✓ (qualified accounts) | See note [4](#fn4) | ✓ (qualified accounts) | See note [4](#fn4) | See note [4](#fn4) |

1 On Vertex AI, web search is available for Claude 4 models and later.  
2 Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE`. See [Auto mode configuration](auto-mode-config.md).  
3 Explicit intervals such as `/loop every 2 hours` work on every provider. On Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Foundry, `/loop` cannot pick its own interval or supply the default maintenance prompt, so a prompt with no interval runs every 10 minutes, and `/loop` with no arguments shows the usage message. See [Scheduled tasks](scheduled-tasks.md).  
4 Subject to your agreement with the cloud provider.  
5 Dashboard and API only. [Contribution metrics](analytics.md) requires a claude.ai Team or Enterprise organization.

If you authenticate through an [LLM gateway](llm-gateway.md), feature availability matches the underlying provider the gateway forwards to. Some Anthropic-only features such as the [Advisor](advisor.md) work only if the gateway forwards requests intact to the Anthropic API.

### [​](#summary-by-provider) Summary by provider

Each tab lists what is unavailable or partially supported on that provider, with alternatives where one exists. Everything not listed works the same as on a Claude subscription. On Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry, and Claude Platform on AWS, error reporting and telemetry to Anthropic are off by default. See [default behaviors by API provider](data-usage.md) for what traffic still reaches Anthropic and how to opt out.

## [​](#availability-by-subscription-plan) Availability by subscription plan

If you authenticate through Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry, or an Anthropic Console API key, this section does not apply to you. When you sign in with a claude.ai account, your plan determines which of the features below are available.

6 On Enterprise, requires a premium seat or a Chat + Claude Code seat. See [Claude Code on the web](claude-code-on-the-web.md).  
7 Not included in the standard Enterprise plan. Requires separate enablement by Anthropic for qualified accounts. See [Zero Data Retention](zero-data-retention.md).
For pricing and the full plan comparison, see [Team plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9266767-what-is-the-team-plan) and [Enterprise plans](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9797531-what-is-the-enterprise-plan).

## [​](#model-availability) Model availability

For which Claude models and context-window sizes are available per provider and region, see [Model configuration](model-config.md) and the [Models overview](about-claude/models/overview.md). Vision, PDF input, and extended thinking are model capabilities rather than Claude Code features and work on every provider that offers the model. [Prompt caching](prompt-caching.md) works the same way on most providers; on Bedrock, support varies by model.
