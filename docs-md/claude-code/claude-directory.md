# Explore the .claude directory

Claude Code reads instructions, settings, skills, subagents, and memory from your project directory and from `~/.claude` in your home directory. Commit project files to git to share them with your team; files in `~/.claude` are personal configuration that applies across all your projects.
On Windows, `~/.claude` resolves to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`. If you set [`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`](env-vars.md), every `~/.claude` path on this page lives under that directory instead.
Most users only edit `CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json`. The rest of the directory is optional: add skills, rules, or subagents as you need them.

Project instructions Claude reads every session

committed

When it loads

Loaded into context at the start of every session

Project-specific instructions that shape how Claude works in this repository. Put your conventions, common commands, and architectural context here so Claude operates with the same assumptions your team does.

Tips

●Target under 200 lines. Longer files still load in full but may reduce adherence

●CLAUDE.md loads into every session. If something only matters for specific tasks, move it to a [skill](skills.md) or a path-scoped [rule](memory.md) so it loads only when needed

●List the commands you run most, like build, test, and format, so Claude knows them without you spelling them out each time

●Run `/memory` to open and edit CLAUDE.md from within a session

●Also works at `.claude/CLAUDE.md` if you prefer to keep the project root clean

This example is for a TypeScript and React project. It lists the build and test commands, the framework conventions Claude should follow, and project-specific rules like export style and file layout.

CLAUDE.mdCopy

```
# Project conventions

## Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Stack
- TypeScript with strict mode
- React 19, functional components only

## Rules
- Named exports, never default exports
- Tests live next to source: `foo.ts` -> `foo.test.ts`
- All API routes return `{ data, error }` shape
```

## [​](#what’s-not-shown) What’s not shown

The explorer covers files you author and edit. A few related files live elsewhere:

| File | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `managed-settings.json` | System-level, varies by OS | Enterprise-enforced settings that you can’t override. See [server-managed settings](server-managed-settings.md). |
| `CLAUDE.local.md` | Project root | Your private preferences for this project, loaded alongside CLAUDE.md. Create it manually and add it to `.gitignore`. |
| Installed plugins | `~/.claude/plugins` | Cloned marketplaces, installed plugin versions, and per-plugin data, managed by `claude plugin` commands. Orphaned versions are deleted 7 days after a plugin update or uninstall. See [plugin caching](plugins-reference.md). |

`~/.claude` also holds data Claude Code writes as you work: transcripts, prompt history, file snapshots, caches, and logs. See [application data](#application-data) below.

## [​](#choose-the-right-file) Choose the right file

Different kinds of customization live in different files. Use this table to find where a change belongs.

| You want to | Edit | Scope | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Give Claude project context and conventions | `CLAUDE.md` | project or global | [Memory](memory.md) |
| Allow or block specific tool calls | `settings.json` `permissions` or `hooks` | project or global | [Permissions](permissions.md), [Hooks](hooks.md) |
| Run a script before or after tool calls | `settings.json` `hooks` | project or global | [Hooks](hooks.md) |
| Set environment variables for the session | `settings.json` `env` | project or global | [Settings](settings.md) |
| Keep personal overrides out of git | `settings.local.json` | project only | [Settings scopes](settings.md) |
| Add a prompt or capability you invoke with `/name` | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | project or global | [Skills](skills.md) |
| Define a specialized subagent with its own tools | `agents/*.md` | project or global | [Subagents](sub-agents.md) |
| Connect external tools over MCP | `.mcp.json` | project only | [MCP](mcp.md) |
| Change how Claude formats responses | `output-styles/*.md` | project or global | [Output styles](output-styles.md) |

## [​](#file-reference) File reference

This table lists every file the explorer covers. Project-scope files live in your repo under `.claude/` (or at the root for `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, and `.worktreeinclude`). Global-scope files live in `~/.claude/` and apply across all projects.

Several things can override what you put in these files:

- [Managed settings](server-managed-settings.md) deployed by your organization take precedence over everything
- CLI flags like `--permission-mode` or `--settings` override `settings.json` for that session
- Some environment variables take precedence over their equivalent setting, but this varies: check the [environment variables reference](env-vars.md) for each one

See [settings precedence](settings.md) for the full order.

## [​](#troubleshoot-configuration) Troubleshoot configuration

If a setting, hook, or file isn’t taking effect, scan the symptoms below.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hook never fires | `matcher` is a JSON array instead of a string | Use a single string with `|` to match multiple tools, for example `"Edit|Write"`. See [matcher patterns](hooks.md). |
| Hook never fires | `matcher` value is lowercase, for example `"bash"` | Matching is case-sensitive. Tool names are capitalized: `Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Read`. |
| Hook never fires | Hooks are in a standalone `.claude/hooks.json` file | There is no standalone hooks file. Define hooks under the `"hooks"` key in `settings.json`. See [hook configuration](hooks.md). |
| Permissions, hooks, or env set globally are ignored | Configuration was added to `~/.claude.json` | `~/.claude.json` holds app state and UI toggles. `permissions`, `hooks`, and `env` belong in `~/.claude/settings.json`. These are two different files. |
| A `settings.json` value seems ignored | The same key is set in `settings.local.json` | `settings.local.json` overrides `settings.json`, and both override `~/.claude/settings.json`. See [settings precedence](settings.md). |
| Skill doesn’t appear in `/skills` | Skill file is at `.claude/skills/name.md` instead of in a folder | Use a folder with `SKILL.md` inside: `.claude/skills/name/SKILL.md`. |
| Subdirectory `CLAUDE.md` instructions seem ignored | Subdirectory files load on demand, not at session start | They load when Claude reads a file in that directory with the Read tool, not at launch and not when writing or creating files there. See [how CLAUDE.md files load](memory.md). |
| Subagent ignores `CLAUDE.md` instructions | Subagents don’t always inherit project memory | Put critical rules in the agent file body, which becomes the subagent’s system prompt. See [subagent configuration](sub-agents.md). |
| Cleanup logic never runs at session end | No `SessionEnd` hook configured | `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` both exist. See the [hook events list](hooks.md). |
| MCP servers in `.mcp.json` never load | File is under `.claude/` or uses Claude Desktop’s config format | Project MCP config lives at the repository root as `.mcp.json`, not inside `.claude/`. See [MCP configuration](mcp.md). |
| Project MCP server added but doesn’t appear | The one-time approval prompt was dismissed | Project-scoped servers require approval. Run `/mcp` to see status and approve. |
| MCP server fails to start from some directories | `command` or `args` uses a relative file path | Use absolute paths for local scripts. Executables on your `PATH` like `npx` or `uvx` work as-is. |
| MCP server starts without expected environment variables | Variables are in `settings.json` `env`, which doesn’t propagate to MCP child processes | Set per-server `env` inside `.mcp.json` instead. |
| `Bash(rm *)` deny rule doesn’t block `/bin/rm` or `find -delete` | Prefix rules match the literal command string, not the underlying executable | Add explicit patterns for each variant, or use a [PreToolUse hook](hooks-guide.md) or the [sandbox](sandboxing.md) for a hard guarantee. |

## [​](#check-what-loaded) Check what loaded

The explorer shows what files can exist. To see what actually loaded in your current session, use these commands:

| Command | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| `/context` | Token usage by category: system prompt, memory files, skills, MCP tools, and messages |
| `/memory` | Which CLAUDE.md and rules files loaded, plus auto-memory entries |
| `/agents` | Configured subagents and their settings |
| `/hooks` | Active hook configurations |
| `/mcp` | Connected MCP servers and their status |
| `/skills` | Available skills from project, user, and plugin sources |
| `/permissions` | Current allow and deny rules |
| `/doctor` | Installation and configuration diagnostics |

Run `/context` first for the overview, then the specific command for the area you want to investigate.

## [​](#application-data) Application data

Beyond the config you author, `~/.claude` holds data Claude Code writes during sessions. These files are plaintext. Anything that passes through a tool lands in a transcript on disk: file contents, command output, pasted text.

### [​](#cleaned-up-automatically) Cleaned up automatically

Files in the paths below are deleted on startup once they’re older than [`cleanupPeriodDays`](settings.md). The default is 30 days.

| Path under `~/.claude/` | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl` | Full conversation transcript: every message, tool call, and tool result |
| `projects/<project>/<session>/tool-results/` | Large tool outputs spilled to separate files |
| `file-history/<session>/` | Pre-edit snapshots of files Claude changed, used for [checkpoint restore](checkpointing.md) |
| `plans/` | Plan files written during [plan mode](permission-modes.md) |
| `debug/` | Per-session debug logs, written only when you start with `--debug` or run `/debug` |
| `paste-cache/`, `image-cache/` | Contents of large pastes and attached images |
| `session-env/` | Per-session environment metadata |

### [​](#kept-until-you-delete-them) Kept until you delete them

The following paths are not covered by automatic cleanup and persist indefinitely.

| Path under `~/.claude/` | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `history.jsonl` | Every prompt you’ve typed, with timestamp and project path. Used for up-arrow recall. |
| `stats-cache.json` | Aggregated token and cost counts shown by `/cost` |
| `backups/` | Timestamped copies of `~/.claude.json` taken before config migrations |
| `todos/` | Legacy per-session task lists. No longer written by current versions; safe to delete. |

`shell-snapshots/` holds runtime files removed when the session exits cleanly. Other small cache and lock files appear depending on which features you use and are safe to delete.

### [​](#plaintext-storage) Plaintext storage

Transcripts and history are not encrypted at rest. OS file permissions are the only protection. If a tool reads a `.env` file or a command prints a credential, that value is written to `projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl`. To reduce exposure:

- Lower `cleanupPeriodDays` to shorten how long transcripts are kept
- Set the [`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY`](env-vars.md) environment variable to skip writing transcripts and prompt history in any mode. In non-interactive mode, you can instead pass `--no-session-persistence` alongside `-p`, or set `persistSession: false` in the Agent SDK.
- Use [permission rules](permissions.md) to deny reads of credential files

### [​](#clear-local-data) Clear local data

You can delete any of the application-data paths above at any time. New sessions are unaffected. The table below shows what you lose for past sessions.

| Delete | You lose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.claude/projects/` | Resume, continue, and rewind for past sessions |
| `~/.claude/history.jsonl` | Up-arrow prompt recall |
| `~/.claude/file-history/` | Checkpoint restore for past sessions |
| `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` | Historical totals shown by `/cost` |
| `~/.claude/backups/` | Rollback copies of `~/.claude.json` from past config migrations |
| `~/.claude/debug/`, `~/.claude/plans/`, `~/.claude/paste-cache/`, `~/.claude/image-cache/`, `~/.claude/session-env/` | Nothing user-facing |
| `~/.claude/todos/` | Nothing. Legacy directory not written by current versions. |

Don’t delete `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, or `~/.claude/plugins/`: those hold your auth, preferences, and installed plugins.
