# Tools reference

Claude Code has access to a set of tools that help it understand and modify your codebase. The tool names below are the exact strings you use in [permission rules](permissions.md), [subagent tool lists](sub-agents.md), and [hook matchers](hooks.md).

| Tool | Description | Permission Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Agent` | Spawns a [subagent](sub-agents.md) with its own context window to handle a task | No |
| `AskUserQuestion` | Asks multiple-choice questions to gather requirements or clarify ambiguity | No |
| `Bash` | Executes shell commands in your environment. See [Bash tool behavior](#bash-tool-behavior) | Yes |
| `CronCreate` | Schedules a recurring or one-shot prompt within the current session (gone when Claude exits). See [scheduled tasks](scheduled-tasks.md) | No |
| `CronDelete` | Cancels a scheduled task by ID | No |
| `CronList` | Lists all scheduled tasks in the session | No |
| `Edit` | Makes targeted edits to specific files | Yes |
| `EnterPlanMode` | Switches to plan mode to design an approach before coding | No |
| `EnterWorktree` | Creates an isolated [git worktree](common-workflows.md) and switches into it | No |
| `ExitPlanMode` | Presents a plan for approval and exits plan mode | Yes |
| `ExitWorktree` | Exits a worktree session and returns to the original directory | No |
| `Glob` | Finds files based on pattern matching | No |
| `Grep` | Searches for patterns in file contents | No |
| `ListMcpResourcesTool` | Lists resources exposed by connected [MCP servers](mcp.md) | No |
| `LSP` | Code intelligence via language servers. Reports type errors and warnings automatically after file edits. Also supports navigation operations: jump to definitions, find references, get type info, list symbols, find implementations, trace call hierarchies. Requires a [code intelligence plugin](discover-plugins.md) and its language server binary | No |
| `NotebookEdit` | Modifies Jupyter notebook cells | Yes |
| `PowerShell` | Executes PowerShell commands on Windows. Opt-in preview. See [PowerShell tool](#powershell-tool) | Yes |
| `Read` | Reads the contents of files | No |
| `ReadMcpResourceTool` | Reads a specific MCP resource by URI | No |
| `Skill` | Executes a [skill](skills.md) within the main conversation | Yes |
| `TaskCreate` | Creates a new task in the task list | No |
| `TaskGet` | Retrieves full details for a specific task | No |
| `TaskList` | Lists all tasks with their current status | No |
| `TaskOutput` | (Deprecated) Retrieves output from a background task. Prefer `Read` on the task’s output file path | No |
| `TaskStop` | Kills a running background task by ID | No |
| `TaskUpdate` | Updates task status, dependencies, details, or deletes tasks | No |
| `TodoWrite` | Manages the session task checklist. Available in non-interactive mode and the [Agent SDK](headless.md); interactive sessions use TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskList, and TaskUpdate instead | No |
| `ToolSearch` | Searches for and loads deferred tools when [tool search](mcp.md) is enabled | No |
| `WebFetch` | Fetches content from a specified URL | Yes |
| `WebSearch` | Performs web searches | Yes |
| `Write` | Creates or overwrites files | Yes |

Permission rules can be configured using `/permissions` or in [permission settings](settings.md). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](permissions.md).

## [​](#bash-tool-behavior) Bash tool behavior

The Bash tool runs each command in a separate process with the following persistence behavior:

- Working directory persists across commands. Set `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1` to reset to the project directory after each command.
- Environment variables do not persist. An `export` in one command will not be available in the next.

Activate your virtualenv or conda environment before launching Claude Code. To make environment variables persist across Bash commands, set [`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`](env-vars.md) to a shell script before launching Claude Code, or use a [SessionStart hook](hooks.md) to populate it dynamically.

## [​](#powershell-tool) PowerShell tool

On Windows, Claude Code can run PowerShell commands natively instead of routing through Git Bash. This is an opt-in preview.

### [​](#enable-the-powershell-tool) Enable the PowerShell tool

Set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` in your environment or in `settings.json`:

```shiki
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL": "1"
  }
}
```

Claude Code auto-detects `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7+) with a fallback to `powershell.exe` (PowerShell 5.1). The Bash tool remains registered alongside the PowerShell tool, so you may need to ask Claude to use PowerShell.

### [​](#shell-selection-in-settings-hooks-and-skills) Shell selection in settings, hooks, and skills

Three additional settings control where PowerShell is used:

- `"defaultShell": "powershell"` in [`settings.json`](settings.md): routes interactive `!` commands through PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.
- `"shell": "powershell"` on individual [command hooks](hooks.md): runs that hook in PowerShell. Hooks spawn PowerShell directly, so this works regardless of `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL`.
- `shell: powershell` in [skill frontmatter](skills.md): runs `` !`command` `` blocks in PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.

### [​](#preview-limitations) Preview limitations

The PowerShell tool has the following known limitations during the preview:

- Auto mode does not work with the PowerShell tool yet
- PowerShell profiles are not loaded
- Sandboxing is not supported
- Only supported on native Windows, not WSL
- Git Bash is still required to start Claude Code
